        "answer": "Rental yields in prime commercial projects along Sohna Road typically range between 6 percent and 8 percent annually, depending on the property type, developer reputation, and whether the unit is pre-leased or vacant. Retail shops in high-street formats near densely populated sectors usually command the upper end of this spectrum due to guaranteed footfall and tenant demand from large brands."
