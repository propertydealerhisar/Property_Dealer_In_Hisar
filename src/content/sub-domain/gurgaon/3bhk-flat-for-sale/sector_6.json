      },
      {
        "question": "Are builder floors or society apartments more common in Sector 6",
        "answer": "Sector 6 is predominantly known for established residential colonies and a higher concentration of builder floors. While some group housing societies may exist nearby, the main inventory for 3BHK flats consists of independent floors built on residential plots.

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the appreciation potential for a 3BHK flat investment here",
        "answer": "The appreciation potential in Sector 6 is robust due to its central location and limited availability of new land parcels. As an established micro-market, properties maintain steady demand. Proximity to industrial hubs and major road networks ensures sustained demand from both tenants and end-users, predicting moderate to high capital appreciation over the medium to long term."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation should I check before purchasing a 3BHK builder floor",
        "answer": "Key documents to verify include the original Parent Deed and Sale Deeds, the registered building plan approval from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram MCG, the Occupancy Certificate OC if applicable, clear title verification confirming no existing liens, and a complete set of RERA documents if the project falls under its purview. Always engage a legal expert to review these thoroughly."

        "question": "How are the maintenance charges typically structured in Sector 6 flats",
        "answer": "For society apartments, maintenance charges are standardized and collected monthly by the Resident Welfare Association RWA or management body. For builder floors, maintenance is generally less structured and often involves pooling resources among floor owners for shared services like water pumps, common area cleaning, and security. Charges are generally lower than in high-rise complexes."
      },

The Super Area for these units can range from 1400 sq ft to 2000 sq ft, depending on the builder's calculation methods and the size of common areas shared. Always clarify the exact carpet area mentioned in the sale agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking included with the purchase of a 3BHK flat here",
        "answer": "Parking provisions vary significantly. In newer builder floors in Sector 6, stilt parking or basement parking is generally included, offering one dedicated car slot per flat. For older properties, parking might be restricted to an open area within the boundary wall or roadside parking. Ensure the specific parking arrangement is clearly documented in your sale agreement."
