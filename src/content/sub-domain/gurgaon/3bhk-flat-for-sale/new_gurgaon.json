      {
        "question": "What is the typical size range for a 3BHK Flat in New Gurgaon",
        "answer": "The typical built-up area for a modern 3BHK flat in New Gurgaon Gurugram generally ranges between 1600 square feet to 2400 square feet, depending on the builder and the specific project category—premium or luxury.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is New Gurgaon a good investment location right now for a 3BHK apartment",
        "answer": "Yes, New Gurgaon is considered one of the best areas for real estate investment in the NCR region. The major growth drivers include the completion of the Dwarka Expressway, proximity to the Manesar industrial area, and massive infrastructural projects like Global City. These factors ensure high demand, translating into significant capital appreciation and strong rental yields, especially for spacious 3BHK units catering to affluent families."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common extra costs associated with purchasing a 3BHK flat here",
        "answer": "Beyond the basic sale price, buyers must account for several other costs. These typically include Goods and Services Tax GST, stamp duty and registration charges which are generally around 7 percent of the property value, Internal Development Charges IDC, External Development Charges EDC, and the cost of parking spaces. Always request a detailed, all-inclusive pricing sheet from the developer or broker before finalising the purchase."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the connectivity of New Gurgaon to key areas like Cyber Hub and IGI Airport",
        "answer": "Connectivity is excellent and continually improving. Via NH 48 and the Dwarka Expressway, Cyber Hub and major corporate zones are reachable within 25 to 40 minutes during non-peak hours. IGI Airport Terminal 3 is also accessible in roughly 40 minutes. Furthermore, several sectors in New Gurgaon are well-connected by wide service roads, ensuring smooth local commutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are most of the 3BHK projects in New Gurgaon fully completed or still under construction",
        "answer": "New Gurgaon features a mix of both ready-to-move-in and under-construction inventory. Many initial phases of development in sectors like 81, 82, and 83 are complete, offering immediate possession. Newer luxury projects, particularly those closer to the Dwarka Expressway, are still in the mid-stages of construction. Buying ready-to-move properties eliminates rental burden and GST, while under-construction units often offer better entry pricing."

      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to pay Goods and Services Tax GST on ready-to-move 3BHK apartments",
        "answer": "No, according to current tax laws, GST is not applicable on the purchase of ready-to-move-in residential properties for which the Completion Certificate CC has been issued by the relevant authority. GST is only levied on under-construction properties where possession is yet to be delivered. This distinction is important and can lead to significant savings for buyers opting for immediate possession."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors should I consider when choosing a specific sector in New Gurgaon",
        "answer": "When selecting a sector for your 3BHK flat, consider proximity to your workplace, current state of civic infrastructure—roads and utility supply, availability of reputed schools and hospitals nearby, and the expected capital appreciation potential. Sectors closer to the Dwarka Expressway offer newer infrastructure while those near NH 48 generally have more established social amenities and connectivity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical maintenance cost for a 3BHK unit in a premium society",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can foreigners or Non-Resident Indians NRI purchase a 3BHK Flat For Sale in New Gurgaon",
