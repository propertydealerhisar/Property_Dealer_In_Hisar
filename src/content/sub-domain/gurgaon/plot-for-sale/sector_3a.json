        "answer": "Essential documents typically include the registry deed or sale deed, original allotment letters from the relevant authority, clear title certificates confirming the seller's absolute ownership, and the latest mutation records.

      },
      {
        "question": "Are the plots in Sector 3A RERA registered and what does this mean for the buyer",
        "answer": "Since Sector 3A is largely a developed sector under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation Gurugram (MCG) and consists mostly of resale plots, RERA registration typically does not apply directly unless the plot is part of a newly developed, large-scale layout by a specific developer. However, the purchase process follows strict governmental land transfer protocols ensuring legal compliance and buyer safety under state laws."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the floor area ratio or FAR guidelines for construction on a residential plot in Sector 3A",

Generally, residential plots allow for construction up to four independent floors plus stilt parking. It is vital to consult with a local architect or our team to understand the specific FAR applicable to your chosen plot dimension before starting design work."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I begin construction after finalizing the purchase of my plot",
        "answer": "Provided the plot has a clear title and the registration process is complete, you can begin the construction planning phase immediately. Since Sector 3A is already developed, you only need to secure the necessary building plan approval from the MCG, a process which our associated legal and architectural experts can assist in expediting. Construction can usually commence within a few months of purchase completion and plan submission."

        "question": "Are there any specific restrictions on the type of construction allowed in Sector 3A",
        "answer": "Construction in Sector 3A is regulated primarily for residential use.
