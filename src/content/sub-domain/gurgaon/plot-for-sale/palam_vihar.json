    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical price range for a residential plot in Palam Vihar Gurugram",
        "answer": "The price of a Plot For Sale in Palam Vihar is highly dependent on its size, exact block location, road width, and whether it is corner-facing or park-facing. Generally, entry-level plot prices start higher than in surrounding sectors due to the area's established reputation and infrastructure. While a 4 Marla plot might start at a specific range, larger 10 Marla or 12 Marla plots in prime blocks will command significantly higher premiums. We recommend speaking with our sales team who can provide the latest real-time pricing data based on your specific requirements and budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the plots in Palam Vihar generally freehold or leasehold properties",
        "answer": "The majority of residential plots available in established sectors like Palam Vihar are freehold properties, which is highly advantageous for buyers. Freehold status means you have complete and perpetual ownership rights over the land, including the right to transfer, mortgage, or sell without requiring long-term government permissions. We exclusively deal in verified plots with clear freehold titles to ensure maximum legal security and ease of future transactions for our clients."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the floor area ratio (FAR) limitations for constructing a house on a plot here",
        "answer": "The Floor Area Ratio (FAR) regulations in Palam Vihar are governed by the specific zonal development plans of the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP), Gurugram. FAR determines the maximum amount of constructed floor space permissible on a given plot size. These regulations are periodically updated, but generally, Palam Vihar allows for generous construction possibilities, often permitting stilt parking plus three or four residential floors, depending on the plot size. We provide up-to-date FAR calculations for every listed plot."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important is the direction of the plot like North-facing or East-facing for resale value",
        "answer": "Plot direction plays a significant role in buyer preference, often influencing both demand and resale value, particularly within the Gurugram market. East-facing and North-facing plots are typically considered auspicious according to Vastu Shastra principles and are therefore highly sought after. While an East-facing plot is excellent for sunlight and positive energy, a North-facing plot is highly favored for commercial or investment considerations. Though less critical than location and title, the direction can certainly fetch a premium during resale."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for obtaining construction approval after buying a plot",
        "answer": "Once you finalize a Plot For Sale in Palam Vihar, the process of gaining construction approval involves submitting your architectural plans to the concerned municipal authority, typically the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) or DTCP. This requires detailed drawings, structural stability certificates, and proof of plot ownership. The approval process can take several weeks, but our expert team can connect you with reliable architects and expeditors who specialize in navigating the local government regulations smoothly and efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any issues with water logging or drainage in Palam Vihar during monsoon season",
        "answer": "Palam Vihar, being a well-established and systematically planned sector, generally boasts superior underground drainage and storm water management systems compared to newly developed areas. While heavy monsoons can challenge any urban infrastructure, the primary blocks of Palam Vihar are engineered to minimize water logging. When reviewing a specific plot, we always inspect the surrounding road height and local drainage infrastructure to ensure minimal disruption during the rainy season."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Palam Vihar considered a good location for investment purely for land appreciation",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Palam Vihar is highly regarded as an excellent location for pure land appreciation investment. Its maturity means the infrastructure risk is negligible, and its strategic connectivity to Delhi and key Gurugram corporate sectors ensures sustained demand. The limited availability of prime residential land here acts as a constant upward pressure on prices, promising robust returns over medium to long terms, making any Plot For Sale in Palam Vihar a safe portfolio addition."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation should I verify before completing the plot purchase transaction",
        "answer": "Comprehensive due diligence is critical. Key documents to verify include the registered sale deed, the latest revenue records showing clear title (Fard/Jamabandi), the mutation certificate (Intkaal), a clear Non-Encumbrance Certificate (EC), and confirmation of property tax clearance. For any plots acquired through prior power of attorney, the legality of that transfer must be meticulously checked. Our team provides full documentation support and legal verification services for every listed property."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are commercial activities restricted on residential plots in Palam Vihar",
        "answer": "Yes, Palam Vihar is predominantly designated as a residential area, and most plots are sold strictly for residential purposes. While certain small-scale professional activities might be permitted under specific municipal rules (like a doctor’s clinic or home office), large-scale commercial operations are generally prohibited to maintain the residential character and peace of the neighborhood. Buyers should confirm specific commercial usage guidelines with the MCG before initiating any non-residential project."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) easily purchase a plot in this locality",
        "answer": "Yes, NRIs can legally and easily purchase a residential Plot For Sale in Palam Vihar, subject to the regulations outlined by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).
