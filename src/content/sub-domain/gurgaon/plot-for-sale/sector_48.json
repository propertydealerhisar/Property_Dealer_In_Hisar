      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rate of appreciation for residential plots in Sector 48",
        "answer": "Sector 48 is a high-demand area due to its established infrastructure and strategic location near Sohna Road and major commercial hubs. Historically the capital appreciation rate for plots here has been robust often outpacing inflation and apartment rates typically ranging between 8-12% per annum depending on the specific location block size and market conditions. However real estate performance is subject to cyclical market changes and prospective buyers should review recent transactional data for the most accurate current projections."

      {
        "question": "Do I need RERA registration when buying a private residential plot in Sector 48",
        "answer": "If you are purchasing a single standalone plot from an individual seller RERA registration may not apply directly to that transaction. However if the Plot For Sale in Sector 48 is part of a newly launched or developing residential colony or project that includes multiple plots offered by a developer that project must be RERA registered. Our team verifies the RERA status where applicable ensuring all plots comply with necessary state regulations protecting your investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is crucial before finalizing the purchase of a plot in Sector 48",
        "answer": "Key documentation includes the original Title Deed or Sale Deed showing the seller's clear ownership the Mutation Record Fard from the revenue department which proves transfer of ownership to the current seller and the latest property tax receipts showing no outstanding dues.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 48 Gurugram prone to water logging during the monsoon season",
        "answer": "Sector 48 benefits from well-planned and established storm water drainage systems due to its development as an authorized HUDA sector and proximity to well-managed private colonies. While localized minor issues can occur in any urban area the main roads and residential blocks in Sector 48 generally maintain good elevation and efficient drainage significantly reducing the risk of major water logging even during heavy monsoon periods providing a distinct advantage over newer less developed sectors."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical maintenance charges or association fees for plots here",

        "question": "Are there any restrictions on building commercial property on residential plots",
        "answer": "Yes the plots listed under 'Plot For Sale in Sector 48' are strictly zoned for residential use. Building commercial structures or operating full-scale commercial businesses on these plots is generally prohibited by DTCP regulations. However local laws often permit the operation of small professional offices or certain home-based services but any large-scale commercial activity would require re-zoning and official approvals which are difficult to obtain for residential plots."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it typically take to get possession after registration of the plot",
        "answer": "For fully developed residential plots in Sector 48 possession is transferred immediately upon successful registration of the Sale Deed in the buyer's name.
