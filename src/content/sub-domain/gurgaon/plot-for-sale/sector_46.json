These plans are then submitted to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) or the relevant municipal corporation for sanctioning. This approval process typically takes several weeks and is a prerequisite before commencing any groundbreaking work on your newly acquired plot for sale in Sector 46"
