    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the typical price ranges for a residential Plot For Sale in Sohna Road",
        "answer": "Plot prices on Sohna Road vary widely based on the specific micro-location, proximity to the main highway, and the status of the development (licensed colony versus private developer land). Generally, prices start from INR 50,000 per square yard for plots in outer sectors and can go up to INR 85,000 per square yard or more in premium, fully developed sectors closer to Gurugram city limits. Factors like plot size and corner status also influence the final cost significantly, so it is best to consult with our experts for location-specific pricing updates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the investment in Sohna Road plots considered secure and legally compliant",
        "answer": "Yes, investment in RERA-approved and HUDA/DTCP licensed colonies on Sohna Road is considered highly secure. We exclusively deal with plots that have clear title deeds and are free from legal encumbrances. We strongly recommend verifying the builder's license, checking the CLU (Change of Land Use) status, and reviewing the necessary approvals from the relevant authorities like the Directorate of Town and Country Planning Gurugram before finalizing any purchase agreement to ensure full compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between HUDA plots and plots in private licensed colonies on Sohna Road",
        "answer": "HUDA (Haryana Urban Development Authority) plots are allocated directly by the state government and are highly structured, often coming with fully developed infrastructure. Private licensed colonies, on the other hand, are developed by private builders under a DTCP license. While both are legally sound, private plots often offer more customization options and may have access to superior amenities provided by the developer, though infrastructure charges might be integrated into the purchase price."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are bank loan facilities available for purchasing a residential Plot For Sale in Sohna Road",
        "answer": "Yes, major banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) offer plot loans for purchasing residential land in approved sectors along Sohna Road, provided the plot is located in a licensed or government-approved residential area. The loan-to-value ratio usually ranges between 60% and 70% of the plot value. We assist our clients in connecting with lending partners who specialize in land financing in the Gurugram region."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical possession timelines after buying a plot in Sohna Road",
        "answer": "Possession timelines depend on the plot's current status. For plots in established, licensed colonies where all infrastructure is complete, physical possession and registry can often happen immediately or within 30 to 45 days of the full payment. For plots in newly launched sectors, possession might be phased, but generally, the documents are clear, allowing for construction to commence soon after the sale deed execution."
      },
      {
        "question": "How has the new Gurgaon-Mumbai Expressway impacted the value of land in Sohna Road",
        "answer": "The Gurgaon-Mumbai Expressway (DMIC) extension has dramatically boosted land values along Sohna Road. It provides rapid access to Manesar, Gurgaon, and Mumbai, transforming Sohna from an outlying area into a key transit hub. The improved connectivity attracts major commercial investment and reduces commute times, directly accelerating the appreciation rates of all residential plots in the corridor substantially."
      },
      {
        "question": "What infrastructure facilities can I expect with a plot purchase in a licensed colony",
        "answer": "Standard facilities in licensed colonies usually include well-paved internal roads, dedicated water supply lines, provision for sewage disposal systems, street lighting, and electricity infrastructure access points.

        "question": "Can Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) easily purchase a Plot For Sale in Sohna Road",
        "answer": "Yes, NRIs are legally permitted to purchase residential and commercial plots in India, including those on Sohna Road, subject to compliance with FEMA regulations.
