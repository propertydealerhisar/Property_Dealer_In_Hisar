        "question": "What are the typical dimensions and sizes of plots available for sale on MG Road",
        "answer": "Residential plots available for sale in and around MG Road Gurugram typically range from smaller 4 Marla units approximately 100 square yards suitable for compact homes to larger 14 Marla plots or even more in premium gated communities. The most common sizes for individual construction are 6 Marla and 8 Marla as they offer a balanced combination of adequate built-up area and manageable investment costs.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is it better to invest in a freehold plot or a leasehold plot near MG Road Gurugram",
        "answer": "In high-demand areas like MG Road Gurugram plots are predominantly offered as freehold properties which is generally the preferred choice for both end-users and long-term investors. A freehold plot grants the buyer complete and perpetual ownership rights over the land and any structures built upon it without limitations on tenure. Leasehold properties on the other hand involve ownership for a specified period after which the land reverts to the lessor typically the government or development authority. Freehold plots offer superior security easier loan availability and greater flexibility for future sale or inheritance making them the safer and more valuable investment option in this prime Gurugram location."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the applicable Floor Area Ratio F.A.R for plots located on MG Road",
        "answer": "The Floor Area Ratio or F.A.R is a critical factor defining the maximum permissible built-up area on your plot relative to its total size. F.A.R regulations in Gurugram particularly near commercial zones like MG Road are governed by the Department of Town and Country Planning DTCP. The exact F.A.R depends on the specific sector plot size and whether the land is part of an approved colony or municipality area. Typically for independent residential plots in approved colonies the F.A.R allows for construction up to four floors plus stilt parking but specific setbacks and ground coverage norms must also be adhered to strictly. Always consult the latest zoning plan or our legal experts to confirm the exact F.A.R before finalizing building plans."

        "question": "What is the typical time frame for plot possession after purchase completion",
        "answer": "For verified freehold plots with clear titles and immediate sale potential the possession process is usually instantaneous upon the execution and registration of the Sale Deed. The time frame primarily revolves around the legal and administrative steps involved such as stamp duty payment document registration and subsequent mutation in government records. This process typically takes between four to six weeks depending on the efficiency of the local sub-registrar office and revenue department in Gurugram. Ready-to-build plots on MG Road often offer the fastest path to possession."

While Gurugram permits certain mixed-use activities on arterial roads strict adherence to zoning laws is enforced especially in established residential sectors close by. Minor home-based professional activities might be permitted but developing a full-scale commercial establishment requires proper conversion and approval from the DTCP which involves different levies and higher taxes.

      },
      {
