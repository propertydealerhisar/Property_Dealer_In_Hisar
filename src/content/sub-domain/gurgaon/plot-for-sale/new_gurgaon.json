    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Is buying a plot in New Gurgaon a good investment decision right now",
        "answer": "Yes, investing in a Plot For Sale in New Gurgaon is widely considered an excellent decision particularly due to the massive infrastructure push, especially along the Dwarka Expressway and SPR corridors. This area is rapidly transforming into a self-sustained micro-market with planned connectivity via the metro and rapid road development. Land appreciation rates here are consistently higher than in established areas of Gurugram due to the lower entry price point and future potential as corporate and residential migration increases toward the region. Focus on RERA-approved township plots for secure returns and compliance guarantees."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical price range for a residential plot in New Gurgaon sectors",
        "answer": "The price range for a residential plot in New Gurgaon can vary significantly based on the sector number, proximity to the expressway, development status of the township, and the plot size itself. Generally, smaller entry-level plots (4-6 Marla) in developed sectors start from Rs 80 Lakhs to Rs 1.5 Crore. Larger premium plots (10 Marla and above) in highly sought-after, integrated townships with immediate possession can range upwards of Rs 3 Crore to Rs 5 Crore or more. It is essential to get an updated price list from a reliable broker specializing in the specific sector you are interested in buying immediately."
      },
      {
        "question": "What legal documents should I verify before purchasing a residential plot",
        "answer": "Before finalizing any purchase of a Plot For Sale in New Gurgaon, you must verify several key legal documents to ensure the property is legitimate and dispute-free. These documents include the title deed or Mother Deed to establish ownership history, the latest revenue record (Jamabandi), the demarcation report, the release certificate from any previous loan, the building plan approval (for the surrounding area), and critically, the RERA registration number of the project. Always ensure the developer has obtained all necessary NOCs from government bodies like DTCP or HUDA before making any payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the plots in New Gurgaon RERA approved and how important is RERA registration",
        "answer": "Yes, most legitimate and newly launched plot projects in New Gurgaon are RERA registered especially those promoted by major organized developers. RERA registration is crucial because it protects the buyer by ensuring the developer adheres to the promised timelines, infrastructure delivery, and specifications. It mandates transparency in transactions and provides a robust grievance redressal mechanism if needed. Always insist on purchasing only those plots that display a valid RERA registration number and verify it on the official state RERA website for complete assurance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between freehold and leasehold property status in New Gurgaon plots",
        "answer": "Freehold ownership means the owner holds full legal rights and title to the land and the structure built upon it in perpetuity without any restriction on transfer or usage subject to local zoning. Most residential plots offered by development authorities (like HUDA plots) or private developers in New Gurgaon are sold on a freehold basis making them highly desirable. Leasehold means the land is owned by a lessor (usually the government or a development authority) and the buyer only holds the right to use it for a fixed term, typically 99 years. Always confirm the status before purchase."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Non-Resident Indians NRI purchase a Plot For Sale in New Gurgaon easily",
        "answer": "Yes, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are legally permitted to purchase both residential and commercial plots in New Gurgaon without major restrictions. The transaction must be completed through designated banking channels. NRIs can utilize their Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) or Non-Resident External (NRE) accounts for funding the purchase. However, special care must be taken regarding power of attorney documentation if the NRI cannot be present for the registry process. We provide specialized legal assistance for all NRI clients ensuring compliance with FEMA guidelines seamlessly."
      },

        "question": "What are the infrastructure benefits surrounding plots along the Dwarka Expressway in New Gurgaon",

Key benefits include superior road connectivity to Delhi’s IGI Airport and established Gurugram areas, proximity to major commercial hubs like Cyber Hub 2.0, planned metro connectivity in Sector 101, and robust civic amenities like underground cabling, modern sewage treatment plants, and institutional sectors earmarked for high-quality schools and hospitals, all contributing to high investment viability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical time frame for plot possession and registry after booking",
        "answer": "If you are purchasing a ready-to-move-in or ready-for-possession Plot For Sale in New Gurgaon within a completed township, the registry and physical possession can usually be completed within 30 to 60 days once the full payment is made and all necessary documentation is finalized. For plots purchased in new launch projects that are still under development, possession will align with the developer's RERA committed timeline, which typically ranges from 1 to 3 years depending on the project status and regulatory clearances."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common hidden costs associated with buying land in New Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Beyond the basic plot price, potential buyers should budget for Stamp Duty and Registration charges which typically total around 7 to 8 percent of the property value depending on gender and urban area classification. Other costs may include External Development Charges (EDC) and Internal Development Charges (IDC) levied by the government, club membership fees if purchasing in a premium township, and legal and brokerage fees. We ensure all these costs are itemized and transparently presented upfront preventing any surprise expenses during closing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the Master Plan 2031 affect investment potential in New Gurgaon plots",
