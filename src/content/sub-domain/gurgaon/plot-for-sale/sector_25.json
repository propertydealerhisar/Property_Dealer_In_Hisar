Key documents to verify include the registered Sale Deed or Conveyance Deed confirming the seller's clear title, the Mutation document (Jamabandi or Rapat) confirming land records updated in the seller's name, and the Non-Encumbrance Certificate (EC) to ensure there are no legal liabilities or mortgages against the property.

      {
        "question": "What are the permissible construction limits on a residential plot in this sector",

Generally, these rules allow for the construction of stilt parking plus multiple floors (e.g., stilt + 4 floors) depending on the plot size and the current by-laws.

        "question": "Are there any infrastructure charges or development fees associated with the plots",
        "answer": "When purchasing a residential plot in an established sector like Sector 25, the major infrastructure development has already been completed and paid for.

      },
