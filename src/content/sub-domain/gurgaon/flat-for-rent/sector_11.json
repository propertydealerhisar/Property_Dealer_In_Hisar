We strongly recommend registering the lease agreement officially with the local authorities."

The standard market practice in Gurugram is to ask for a deposit equivalent to two months' rent, though in premium properties, three months might be requested.

This particular term minimizes complex legal formalities associated with registering longer leases (e.g., stamp duty). However, some landlords may agree to a 12-month or longer contract, especially for stable corporate tenants. Ensure the renewal terms and the annual rent escalation percentage (typically 5% to 10%) are clearly specified and agreed upon in the initial contract agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How reliable is the water and electricity supply for rental properties in sector 11",
        "answer": "Sector 11 is an established and well-managed residential sector and generally experiences very reliable municipal services. Water supply is highly consistent, and electricity supply is robust, often backed up by large society generators in apartment buildings or individual inverters in independent floors to effectively handle rare and short-duration power outages. When viewing a Flat For Rent in sector 11, always inquire about the specific power backup arrangements and whether the operational cost of generator use is included in the monthly maintenance charge or billed separately."

      {
        "question": "Can I find fully furnished flats suitable for short-term corporate stays in sector 11",

These premium units come fully equipped with furniture, electronics, essential appliances, and kitchenware but consequently command a significantly higher rent premium, sometimes 30-50% higher than equivalent unfurnished counterparts due to the added convenience."
