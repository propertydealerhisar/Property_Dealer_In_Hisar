        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a Flat For Rent in sector 49 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for rental agreements in Sector 49 is generally six months to one year. This means that neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the lease during this time without incurring a penalty, usually equivalent to one or two months of rent. We always advise tenants to clarify and negotiate the lock-in clause before signing, especially if your job requires potential relocation. However, after the lock-in period, a typical notice period of one or two months applies for lease termination."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is required for renting a flat in Sector 49",
        "answer": "For a quality Flat For Rent in sector 49, the standard security deposit usually ranges from two to three months of the monthly rent. This deposit is held by the landlord throughout the tenancy period and is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all dues are cleared. High-end or fully furnished properties might sometimes require a slightly higher deposit, so it is important to budget for this initial outlay."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent for properties in Sector 49",
        "answer": "The inclusion of maintenance charges depends entirely on the specific residential society and the terms set by the landlord. In many upscale gated communities offering a Flat For Rent in sector 49, the tenant is responsible for paying the monthly society maintenance fee, which covers common area electricity, security services, and upkeep of amenities. Always confirm whether the advertised rental rate is exclusive or inclusive of these charges to avoid financial surprises later."
