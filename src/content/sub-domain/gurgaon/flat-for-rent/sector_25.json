    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a Flat For Rent in sector 25",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit across Sector 25 rentals generally equates to two months’ rent. This amount is held by the landlord as security against any potential damage to the property or failure to pay rent during the tenancy period. This deposit is fully refundable at the end of the lease term, provided the flat is returned in its original condition and all outstanding utility bills have been cleared. We always ensure this amount and the refund process are clearly stipulated in the legal lease agreement before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility bills included in the monthly rent for flats in Sector 25",
        "answer": "No, typically utility bills are not included in the quoted monthly rent for flats in Sector 25 Gurugram. Tenants are usually responsible for paying electricity consumption, water charges, internet services, and gas connections separately. However, the maintenance fee for the society, which covers common area upkeep and lift operation, may sometimes be included in the rent or charged as a separate fixed monthly cost. Always confirm which utilities and maintenance charges are covered before finalizing the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for rental agreements in this area",
        "answer": "The most common and standard lease duration for a Flat For Rent in sector 25 is 11 months. This duration is widely preferred because it allows the agreement to be registered as a leave and license agreement, avoiding the requirements of formal registration under property laws that apply to leases longer than one year. However, if a tenant requires a longer stay, agreements can be drafted for 12 or 24 months, subject to mutual agreement between the landlord and the tenant, potentially requiring formal registration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 25 considered a safe and family-friendly neighbourhood in Gurugram",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 25 is highly regarded as one of the safest and most family-friendly residential areas in Gurugram. The sector primarily consists of well-maintained residential plots and organized housing societies which prioritize security. Access to quality schools, multiple green parks, and essential healthcare facilities makes it extremely attractive for families. The local community also maintains strong vigil, contributing to a secure living environment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in rental flats in Sector 25 society complexes",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly across different buildings and individual landlords in Sector 25. While some independent landlords may allow pets subject to an increased security deposit, many larger residential societies have strict no-pet policies due to shared common areas. It is crucial to inform us upfront if you have pets so we can specifically filter for pet-friendly Flat For Rent in sector 25 options to avoid disappointment later."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a rental agreement here",
        "answer": "To finalize the agreement for a flat in Sector 25, you will typically need to provide government-issued photo identification such as an Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of employment or source of income, and recent photographs. Foreign nationals will require passport and valid visa copies. We facilitate the creation of the rental deed which requires e-stamping and notarization for legal validation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I find fully furnished Flat For Rent in sector 25 options",

While they carry a slightly higher rent, the convenience and immediate readiness they offer are invaluable for tenants relocating quickly to Gurugram."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often is the rent revised in Sector 25 rental agreements",
        "answer": "Rental agreements in Sector 25 typically include a rent escalation clause. The standard practice is to revise the rent annually, usually increasing by a fixed percentage ranging from 5% to 10%. This revision is usually implemented upon the renewal of the 11-month lease agreement. All terms regarding rent revision are explicitly mentioned in the tenancy contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of parking facilities are available with rented flats",
        "answer": "Most organized societies and independent builder floors in Sector 25 offer dedicated car parking spaces, often one reserved spot per unit. In older or smaller properties, parking may be available on a first-come, first-served basis within the society premises or nearby street parking. When searching for your Flat For Rent in sector 25, confirm if you require covered or open parking."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I move in after selecting a rental flat",
        "answer": "If the property is vacant and the necessary legal documentation is completed quickly, you can typically move in within 3 to 7 days. This timeline accounts for signing the lease, paying the security deposit and first month’s rent, and completing the police verification process required for all new tenants in Gurugram."
