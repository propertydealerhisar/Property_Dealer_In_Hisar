    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the average rent range for a 2 BHK Flat For Rent in sector 1 Gurugram?",
        "answer": "The average rental range for a standard 2 BHK apartment in sector 1 typically falls between INR 15,000 to INR 22,000 per month, depending heavily on the building's age, the specific sub-locality, and the availability of amenities such as power backup and dedicated parking. Newer complexes or flats located very close to the metro station tend to be on the higher end of this scale, while older, well-maintained properties offer more budget-friendly options that still provide essential facilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are most rental flats in sector 1 furnished or unfurnished?",
        "answer": "The majority of available properties listed as Flat For Rent in sector 1 are semi-furnished, meaning they generally include essential fixtures like modular kitchen cabinets, wardrobes, fans, and lights. Fully furnished apartments are less common and usually command a 15% to 30% higher rent, catering primarily to expatriates or those requiring immediate move-in without purchasing furniture. We specify the exact furnishing status clearly on all our listings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security deposit amount is standard when renting an apartment here?",
        "answer": "Landlords in sector 1 typically require a security deposit equivalent to two months' rent. This deposit is fully refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills have been settled. Some premium societies or high-value 3 BHK Flat For Rent options may request a three-month deposit depending on the specific terms set by the owner."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the typical lock-in period for a rental agreement in sector 1?",
        "answer": "Most tenancy contracts for a Flat For Rent in sector 1 impose a mandatory lock-in period of six months. During this time, the tenant cannot terminate the lease without forfeiting the entire security deposit. After the lock-in period, a standard notice period of one to two months is usually required for termination, allowing the landlord adequate time to find a new tenant."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking readily available with a Flat For Rent in sector 1 complexes?",
        "answer": "Parking availability varies significantly across the sector. Flats within high-rise residential societies almost always include one dedicated covered car parking space, sometimes available for an extra charge. However, properties in older standalone buildings might offer limited or street parking only. Always confirm parking status and allocation, especially for two-wheeler and four-wheeler vehicles, before finalizing your rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rented apartments in this sector?",
        "answer": "Pet policies are strictly determined by individual landlords or the Residential Welfare Association RWA of the society. While some modern societies are consciously pet-friendly, many apartments listed as Flat For Rent in sector 1 have strict no-pet policies due to common area constraints. It is absolutely essential to declare your intent to keep a pet upfront during negotiations to avoid complications later."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common utility costs besides the monthly rent?",
        "answer": "Tenants are typically responsible for electricity consumption, piped natural gas PNG charges, and external water charges if applicable. Additionally, residents must pay a monthly maintenance fee to the RWA, which covers common area upkeep, security, lift operation, and sometimes shared water supply, usually ranging from INR 2,000 to INR 4,500 for a 2 or 3 BHK flat depending on the level of luxury amenities provided."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close is sector 1 to major commercial and business hubs in Gurugram?",
        "answer": "Sector 1 boasts an excellent strategic location and superb connectivity. It is centrally situated, offering quick access to the main commercial markets of Old Gurugram and the industrial belts towards Noida and Delhi via the nearby expressway. This makes finding a Flat For Rent in sector 1 highly desirable for professionals and business owners looking for reduced commute times."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are needed to finalize the lease agreement for a flat here?",
        "answer": "To secure a Flat For Rent in sector 1, you will typically need Aadhaar Card proof of identity, PAN Card proof of tax status, employment verification or salary slips, and recent passport-sized photographs. Foreign nationals require passport and valid visa documentation. We assist in verifying all documents prior to agreement execution."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the monthly rent amount for a listed flat?",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is common and expected in the sector 1 rental market, especially for long-term leases 18 months or more. While highly desirable or brand-new listings might allow less room for negotiation, tenants can usually try to negotiate a reduction of 5% to 7% off the quoted rent, depending on current market demand and the property's vacancy duration, which our experts can advise on."
