    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the typical lease terms for a Flat For Rent in south city 2 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Standard lease agreements for residential flats in south city 2 generally follow an 11-month renewable contract structure. This allows both the tenant and the landlord flexibility while maintaining legal compliance under non-registration rules. However, longer leases of 18 or 24 months are also negotiable particularly for corporate leases or premium properties. We always advise carefully reading the renewal clauses and incremental rent hike stipulations which usually range from 5% to 10% upon subsequent renewals."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is usually required for a rental flat in this area",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit for a Flat For Rent in south city 2 is typically equivalent to two months' rent. For high-end, fully furnished apartments or properties in gated communities, the deposit might extend up to three months' rent. This deposit is fully refundable upon the satisfactory handover of the property at the end of the tenancy period provided there are no damages beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding utility bills are cleared."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent or paid separately in south city 2",
        "answer": "This depends entirely on the property type. For Flats For Rent within large builder floor societies or apartment complexes, the Resident Welfare Association RWA maintenance charges are often paid separately by the tenant. These charges cover common area services like security, lift operation, and garbage disposal. For independent builder floors, maintenance is usually minimal and managed directly by the tenant or occasionally included in the monthly rent amount. Clarity on this is provided in every listing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average rent range for 2 BHK flats in south city 2 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The rent for a 2 BHK Flat For Rent in south city 2 varies significantly based on factors like the age of the construction, proximity to the main road or metro link, and whether the flat is furnished or unfurnished. On average, you can expect to pay between ₹14,000 and ₹22,000 per month for a standard semi-furnished 2 BHK. Premium, newly constructed flats with modern amenities may exceed this range while older units or those on the periphery might be slightly lower."
      },

      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price for a flat in south city 2",
        "answer": "Yes, rental prices are often negotiable, especially if you are willing to commit to a longer lease period or if the flat has been vacant for some time. Our experienced agents are skilled negotiators who will advocate on your behalf to secure the best possible monthly rent. Typically, negotiation margins are smaller for properties that are highly sought after or already priced competitively below market value."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do I need to prepare to rent a flat in this area",
        "answer": "Prospective tenants should prepare photocopies and originals of their Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and proof of current employment or student status. You will also need recent passport-sized photographs. If you are a foreign national, a valid passport, visa, and local residential permit are essential. Having these documents ready speeds up the leasing process significantly once you have selected your ideal Flat For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in most rental flats in south city 2",
        "answer": "Pet policies are strictly determined by individual landlords or the RWA rules of the apartment complex. While some independent builder floors are pet-friendly, most large societies in south city 2 impose restrictions or outright bans on pets.

      },
      {
        "question": "What are the best methods for searching for a Flat For Rent quickly in south city 2",
        "answer": "The most efficient method is leveraging a dedicated local real estate platform like ours which specializes in the south city 2 area.
