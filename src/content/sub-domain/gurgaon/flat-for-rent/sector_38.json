        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required when renting a flat in sector 38",
        "answer": "The standard practice for a Flat For Rent in sector 38 Gurugram usually requires a security deposit equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent. However this can vary depending on the property owner and the specific apartment complex.

Always confirm the exact deposit amount and refund conditions in the rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility bills included in the monthly rent for flats in sector 38",
        "answer": "Generally utility bills such as electricity water gas and internet are not included in the standard monthly rent for a Flat For Rent in sector 38. Tenants are typically responsible for paying these consumption charges directly to the respective service providers.

Some landlords may consider six-month leases but this is less frequent and might involve a slightly higher rental rate. If you require a shorter lease term such as three to six months you should specifically look for serviced apartments or properties catering to temporary stays as traditional residential leases are strongly focused on the annual contract."
      },
      {

Our verified listings often specify the availability date. If the flat requires minor cleaning or touch-ups there might be a delay of 1-3 days. For unfurnished flats the move-in process is usually faster while furnished flats might require a day or two for final inventory checks. We prioritize fast transitions for all our tenants."
