      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent for DLF Phase 3 apartments",
        "answer": "It depends entirely on the type of rental property. For apartments within large society complexes major common area maintenance charges such as elevator service and lobby cleaning are often included in the monthly rent or collected separately as part of a fixed monthly fee. However individual utility bills like electricity water and gas consumption are almost always separate and must be paid by the tenant directly based on usage. Always confirm with your property manager whether the rental amount is inclusive or exclusive of common area maintenance fees."

        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and minor wear and tear damages",
