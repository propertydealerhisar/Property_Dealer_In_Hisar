        "answer": "The standard rental agreement duration in New Palam Vihar, similar to most parts of Gurugram, is typically 11 months, which is automatically renewable based on mutual consent between the tenant and the landlord. This 11-month structure avoids the need for property registration which is mandatory for agreements exceeding 12 months, thereby simplifying the legal process and reducing associated costs.

        "answer": "For a standard Flat For Rent in new_palam_vihar, the required security deposit usually ranges from one to two months' worth of the agreed-upon monthly rent.

It is crucial to document the condition of the flat meticulously at the time of move-in. The deposit is fully refundable, generally within 30 to 60 days after vacating the premises, provided all utility bills are cleared and the property is returned in good condition, allowing for fair wear and tear."

      },
      {
        "question": "How can I verify the legal ownership and safety of the rental property before signing?",
