    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a Flat For Rent in Sector 46",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Sector 46, like most of Gurugram, is typically equivalent to two to three months' rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided the property is returned in good condition and there are no outstanding utility bills or damage beyond normal wear and tear. Always ensure this is clearly documented in your rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent for flats in gated societies",
        "answer": "In most gated societies in Sector 46, the policy on maintenance charges varies. For some listings, the monthly society maintenance fee (covering common area electricity, security, and facility upkeep) might be included in the advertised rent. However, often, the tenant is responsible for paying this charge separately to the Resident Welfare Association (RWA). Always clarify this point before signing the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are generally needed to rent an apartment in Sector 46 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Landlords typically require comprehensive documentation for tenant verification. This includes Aadhar Card and PAN Card copies for identity and address proof, recent salary slips or bank statements (for employed individuals), and proof of current residence. A police verification form must also be completed as per local regulations for all new tenants."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 46 well-connected to public transportation options like Metro or Bus services",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 46 enjoys good connectivity. While the nearest operational Metro Station (Badarpur or Old Gurugram) requires a short commute, the sector is very well served by local auto-rickshaws and the city bus network. Its location near NH-19 also ensures swift access for those commuting using private vehicles or company transport services across the NCR."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average rental price range for a 2 BHK Flat in Sector 46",
        "answer": "The average rental price for a well-maintained 2 BHK Flat in Sector 46 typically ranges between ₹15,000 and ₹25,000 per month, depending heavily on the building type (builder floor versus society apartment), age of construction, and the level of furnishing and amenities provided. Premium society flats with power backup and advanced security will naturally command the higher end of this range."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pet owners allowed to rent flats in Sector 46 apartment complexes",
        "answer": "Pet policies are strictly determined by the individual building management or RWA rules. While some independent builder floors might be pet-friendly, many large society complexes in Sector 46 have restrictions on large pets or may require prior written permission and an additional pet deposit. Prospective tenants with pets should specifically inquire about the pet policy before committing to a Flat For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the typical lock-in period for rental agreements in Sector 46 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for a 12-month rental agreement is usually six months. During this time, neither the landlord nor the tenant can terminate the lease without facing financial penalties, usually the forfeiture of the security deposit or equivalent rental payment. This duration is negotiated to provide stability for both parties."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utility bills (electricity, water, gas) are the responsibility of the tenant",
        "answer": "In almost all rental agreements in Sector 46, the tenant is directly responsible for paying their consumption charges for electricity, water, and piped natural gas (PNG), if applicable. The landlord typically ensures the meters are in working order, but the monthly usage bill is the tenant's obligation and is not included in the monthly rent payment."

      {
        "question": "Do I need a broker to find a quality Flat For Rent in Sector 46",
        "answer": "While it is possible to find direct listings, engaging a professional real estate broker specializing in Sector 46 can significantly speed up your search. A good broker provides access to exclusive listings, handles negotiation, assists with documentation, and ensures proper police verification, making the entire process more efficient and secure for the tenant."
