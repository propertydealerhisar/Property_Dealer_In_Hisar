    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit structure for rental flats in new gurugram",
        "answer": "The standard practice in new gurugram for residential rentals is to require a security deposit equivalent to two or three months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is held by the landlord as collateral against property damage or unpaid utility bills. It is crucial that the rental agreement clearly outlines the conditions for the return of the security deposit, including inspection criteria and the timeline for refund after vacating the premises, usually within 30 to 60 days to ensure proper closing procedures are followed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are rental agreements in new gurugram usually registered and what is the typical duration",
        "answer": "Yes, it is highly recommended and often mandatory for all rental agreements exceeding 11 months to be officially registered with the sub-registrar office to provide legal validity. Most leases in this area are structured for 11 months to simplify legal formalities or for a full 12-month period with provisions for mutual renewal clauses. Longer leases like 24 or 36 months are common for corporate rentals but require specific clauses regarding early termination penalties by either the tenant or the landlord."

      },

        "question": "How does the maintenance fee structure work for rental apartments",
        "answer": "Maintenance fees are generally separate from the rent and cover the upkeep of common areas, shared amenities, security services, and sometimes water supply. The responsibility for paying this fee must be clearly defined in the rental agreement.

Most premium flats for rent are located within townships that employ professional security agencies, controlled entry points, and extensive surveillance measures installed throughout the society.

Electricity bills are managed through individual meters provided by the discom, usually involving standard slab rates. Water usage is sometimes included in the maintenance fee in older complexes, but newer high-rise communities often meter water consumption individually.

If the tenant breaks the lease after the lock-in period but before the full term, they are usually required to serve a notice period, commonly 30 to 60 days, and may forfeit one or two months of rent as compensation to the landlord for lost rental income and the administrative cost of re-listing the property."
