    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required when renting a flat in sector 89",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in sector 89 Gurugram usually ranges between two to three months worth of monthly rent. This amount is refundable upon the satisfactory conclusion of the lease period and after deducting costs for any damages beyond normal wear and tear. It is essential that the rental agreement clearly specifies the deposit amount, the conditions for forfeiture, and the timeline for its return typically within 30 to 60 days of vacating the Flat For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the monthly rent for flats in this area",
        "answer": "This varies significantly depending on the society and the specific lease agreement. In some high-rise societies, the landlord may cover the fixed monthly common area maintenance charges as part of the inclusive rent. However, more commonly, the tenant is responsible for these charges, especially in larger 2 BHK or 3 BHK apartments. Always clarify whether the stated rent is 'all-inclusive' or 'exclusive' of society maintenance and utility bills before signing the agreement for your Flat For Rent in sector 89."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration options are generally available in Sector 89 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The most common and legally preferred lease duration is 11 months, often renewable upon mutual agreement. However, we do facilitate longer-term leases of 18 or 24 months, particularly for corporate rentals or established families seeking stability. Short-term rentals are less common but can sometimes be negotiated for fully furnished studio apartments, depending on the landlord's flexibility. Discuss your required lease term with our agents when viewing a Flat For Rent in sector 89."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I move into a Flat For Rent in sector 89 after signing the agreement",
        "answer": "The move-in timeline is highly dependent on whether the flat is currently vacant and how quickly documentation and security deposit transfer are completed. If the Flat For Rent is vacant and the tenant verification process is straightforward, you can often move in within 3 to 7 working days of signing the lease. For flats requiring minor repairs or cleaning, the timeline may extend slightly, but we prioritize minimizing waiting times for our clients."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to secure a rental flat in Sector 89",
        "answer": "To secure a Flat For Rent in sector 89, tenants typically need to provide several key documents.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking available with all rental flats in sector 89",

However, for smaller 1 BHK flats or builder floors, parking might be restricted to open common area slots or require a separate fee. If parking is a crucial requirement, please ensure this is confirmed explicitly in the lease agreement before finalizing your Flat For Rent in sector 89."

      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in flats For Rent in sector 89 societies",

If approved, landlords may request an additional non-refundable pet deposit to cover potential damage caused by the animal in the Flat For Rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and general wear and tear in a rental flat",
        "answer": "Generally, the landlord is responsible for major structural repairs, plumbing leaks, and electrical issues that are not caused by tenant misuse. The tenant is typically responsible for minor running repairs, replacement of consumable items like light bulbs or fuses, and damages resulting from negligence. The lease agreement specifies these responsibilities clearly to avoid future disputes regarding the Flat For Rent in sector 89."
