        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for a Flat For Rent in sector_107",
        "answer": "The standard rental agreement for residential flats in Sector 107 Gurugram is generally for 11 months, which is automatically renewable upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord. Longer lease periods like 18 or 24 months may also be negotiated especially for corporate leases or properties within premium societies. We always advise tenants to thoroughly review the termination clauses and lock-in period details before signing the final contract to understand the terms clearly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is required for rental units in this area",
        "answer": "The typical security deposit for a Flat For Rent in sector_107 is equivalent to two months' rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided the property is returned in good condition, minus any deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear or outstanding utility bills. For higher-end, fully furnished apartments, the landlord might sometimes request a deposit equivalent to three months' rent due to the valuable assets included in the unit."
      },

        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent or paid separately",
        "answer": "This depends entirely on the specific rental agreement. In most large societies in Sector 107, the monthly maintenance fee for common areas, security, and utility backup is paid separately by the tenant directly to the society management. However, some landlords may opt for an 'all-inclusive' rent where the maintenance charge is already factored in. Always clarify this point upfront to avoid future confusion regarding monthly expenses."

      {
        "question": "What documentation is needed to finalize a rental agreement in Sector 107",

      {
        "question": "Are utility bills like electricity and water included in the rent amount",
