    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental cost range for a 2 BHK Flat For Rent in sector 26",
        "answer": "The rental cost for a standard 2 BHK flat in Sector 26, Gurugram generally ranges between INR 15,000 to INR 25,000 per month, depending heavily on factors such as the property's age, whether it is located in a high-rise society or a builder floor, and the level of furnishing provided. Premium flats with advanced amenities, power backup, and dedicated parking might command rents at the higher end of this scale, while older, independent builder floors are usually more budget-friendly. Always factor in the additional maintenance charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are most rental properties in Sector 26 furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "Sector 26 offers a balanced mix, but the majority of available rental properties are typically semi-furnished. Semi-furnished flats usually include essential fixtures like wardrobes, modular kitchens, light fittings, and fans. Fully furnished apartments are available, but they attract a significant premium and are less common in the general market inventory. Unfurnished options are also readily available for tenants who prefer to bring their own furniture."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the standard lease duration requirements in Sector 26 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The standard lease period for residential flats in Sector 26, like most of Gurugram, is 11 months, which is legally renewable. This duration is preferred because it avoids the mandatory registration requirements that apply to leases lasting 12 months or more. Landlords generally prefer long-term tenants, and after the initial 11 months, the lease can often be renewed with a mutual agreement, sometimes incorporating a rent increase clause of 5% to 10%."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much is the security deposit usually required for flats here",
        "answer": "The standard practice in Sector 26 requires tenants to pay a security deposit equivalent to two months' worth of rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy period, provided the flat is returned in good condition, minus any charges for damage beyond normal wear and tear or outstanding utility bills. Always clarify the exact refund terms and process in the lease agreement before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What essential amenities should I expect when renting in this sector",
        "answer": "Flats in organized societies in Sector 26 typically offer essential amenities including 24/7 security surveillance, reliable water supply, and dedicated parking spaces. Many newer complexes also provide power backup facilities for common areas and apartments, high-speed internet wiring, and access to parks or small children’s play areas. Verify which amenities are included in the rent and which may incur extra monthly maintenance charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 26 well-connected to Delhi for daily commuters",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 26 is exceptionally well-connected, making it a favorite for Delhi commuters. It sits close to the NH-44 (Mathura Road) which offers direct vehicular access to South Delhi. Furthermore, the Escorts Mujesar Metro Station is easily accessible, providing a reliable and fast public transport option into the heart of Delhi NCR, significantly reducing travel time and traffic stress."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there maintenance charges applicable separately from the rent",
        "answer": "In society flats or managed properties, yes, maintenance charges are almost always applicable separately from the base rent. These charges cover the upkeep of common areas, security staff salaries, lift operation, and shared utility costs. These fees vary widely, often ranging from INR 2,000 to INR 4,500 per month, depending on the society's facilities and size."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for background checks and police verification for tenants",
        "answer": "Police verification is mandatory for all new tenants in Gurugram. The landlord is legally responsible for submitting the tenant's details and identification proof to the local police station within a stipulated time after the tenancy begins. We assist both parties in ensuring this paperwork is completed promptly and correctly, fulfilling all government regulations regarding tenant identification and safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental flats and society apartments in Sector 26",
        "answer": "The policy on pets varies significantly based on the specific society or the individual landlord. Many large, organized housing societies have strict no-pet policies, or restrictions on pet size and type. It is crucial to inform us upfront if you have pets so we can specifically filter for pet-friendly Flat For Rent in sector 26 options to avoid future conflicts."
      },
      {
