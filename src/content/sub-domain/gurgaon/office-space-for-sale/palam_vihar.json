      {
        "question": "What crucial legal due diligence is required before finalizing the purchase of an office space",
        "answer": "Essential legal due diligence involves verifying the title deed ownership history including checking for any existing mortgages or encumbrances.

      },
      {
        "question": "How does the calculation of common area affect my usable office space investment",
        "answer": "When purchasing commercial space, you typically pay for the super built-up area which includes your carpet area and a proportionate share of the common areas like lobbies elevators stairwells and facility rooms. It is crucial to understand the loading factor or the ratio between the carpet area usable space and the super built-up area as this directly impacts the cost effectiveness of your investment. A lower loading factor means more usable space per unit cost."
      },
      {

        "answer": "Maintenance costs in premium commercial complexes cover services such as 24/7 security, power backup diesel costs, elevator maintenance, common area utilities, and cleaning services. These charges are usually calculated per square foot of the super built-up area and are paid monthly or quarterly by the owner or the tenant depending on the lease agreement structure. Budgeting for these operating expenses is critical for accurate net yield calculation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is financing available for buying commercial office space and what are the terms",
        "answer": "Yes, major national and private banks offer robust financing options for commercial real estate purchases. Loans generally cover 50% to 70% of the property value and repayment tenures can extend up to 15 years. Interest rates are typically slightly higher than residential home loans. Buyers must demonstrate a strong financial history and a clear repayment capacity often requiring a higher down payment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical timeline for closing a deal on an Office Space For Sale in Palam Vihar",
        "answer": "Assuming clear legal documentation, the standard timeline for closing a commercial property purchase usually ranges from 45 to 90 days. This period allows time for loan sanctioning, thorough legal due diligence including title verification, drafting and execution of the sale deed, and final registration at the sub-registrar’s office.
