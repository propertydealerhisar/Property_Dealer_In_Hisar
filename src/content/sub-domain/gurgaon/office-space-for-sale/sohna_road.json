    "description": "Getting expert answers helps clarify the commercial buying process and ensures you make a fully informed decision about your investment on Sohna Road.",
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the current price trends for Grade A office space along Sohna Road",
        "answer": "The pricing for Grade A office space in prominent Sohna Road commercial towers typically ranges significantly based on factors like the specific building developer floor level and amenities offered. Currently, the market demonstrates stable growth with a reliable upward trajectory, driven by high absorption rates from IT and corporate tenants. Smaller managed units might start around INR 10000 per square foot while premium front-facing large floor plates in landmark buildings can command prices well over INR 15000 per square foot. We recommend consulting our latest quarterly market report for the most up-to-date, project-specific valuations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sohna Road a better investment location than Golf Course Road",
        "answer": "While Golf Course Road is highly established and commands top-tier rental rates, Sohna Road often offers a higher potential for capital appreciation and a more varied entry price point for new investors. Sohna Road benefits from better connectivity to the larger NCR region, superior access to the SPR, and offers newer commercial inventory with modern infrastructure. For long-term growth and high rental yields, especially in the managed space segment, Sohna Road provides a compelling and often more accessible investment proposition compared to the highly saturated Golf Course Road market."
      },
      {
        "question": "What regulatory compliances should I check before purchasing commercial property here",
        "answer": "It is essential to verify three key regulatory aspects before finalizing any purchase. First ensure the project is RERA registered and check the compliance track record of the developer. Second verify that the Occupancy Certificate OC has been issued or is guaranteed soon, which confirms the building is structurally complete and legally ready for use. Third always scrutinize the title deed for clear ownership history and check for any outstanding loans or legal encumbrances against the specific office unit or the overall commercial tower."
      },
      {
        "question": "What size office space is most liquid for rental income generation",
        "answer": "The most liquid office spaces are generally those suited for small to medium businesses which typically fall between 500 sq ft and 1500 sq ft area. These smaller units attract a wider range of tenants including startups consultancies and satellite offices from larger corporations. Managed furnished spaces in this size category are especially popular as they minimize tenant setup costs leading to quicker lease agreements and overall higher occupancy rates compared to very large, high-capital bare-shell units."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can foreign nationals or NRIs easily buy commercial property on Sohna Road",
        "answer": "Yes foreign nationals and Non-Resident Indians NRIs are generally permitted to acquire immovable commercial property in India without special prior permissions from the Reserve Bank of India RBI, provided they fully comply with all aspects of FEMA regulations. However, the repatriation of sale proceeds might be subject to certain tax implications and conditions. We strongly advise NRIs to route all investment transactions through an NRO or NRE account and consult with our legal partners specializing in cross-border property transactions to ensure complete compliance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical monthly maintenance charges for office complexes on Sohna Road",

Expect monthly charges to typically range between INR 15 and INR 25 per square foot of the super area. Premium buildings offering extensive common amenities like gyms cafeterias and specialized concierge services may charge slightly higher rates but these are often offset by securing higher overall rental values and better quality tenants."
      },
      {

        "answer": "Reputable commercial developments along Sohna Road are built with robust, modern infrastructure guaranteeing reliable services critical for 24/7 business operations.

        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for commercial tenants on Sohna Road",
        "answer": "Commercial leases in Gurugram especially along Sohna Road are usually structured with a standard term of three to nine years to provide stability. The most common structure is a 3+3+3 year lease with a mandatory lock-in period often set at the first three years for both tenant and landlord. Lease agreements usually include a pre-defined escalation clause typically 15% every three years to protect the investor’s rental return against inflation and natural market increases."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes a particular floor or facing better for investment value",
        "answer": "Offices located on higher floors often command a rental and resale premium due to factors like superior city views increased natural light and significantly less noise pollution exposure. Corner units are highly desirable for the same reasons providing maximum ventilation and light. Regarding facing units overlooking green belts internal courtyards or major arterial roads without direct severe sun exposure are generally preferred by tenants contributing directly to higher rental returns and better resale value."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the entire purchasing process typically take for an office space here",
        "answer": "The timeline for purchasing office space can vary based on whether the property is ready-to-move RTM or under construction. For RTM properties with clear titles the process from finalizing the deal to full registration usually takes between 45 to 60 days assuming the buyer’s financing is pre-approved and documents are in order. Under construction properties naturally require longer wait times related to project completion but the paperwork phase itself remains similar after full payment milestones are met."
