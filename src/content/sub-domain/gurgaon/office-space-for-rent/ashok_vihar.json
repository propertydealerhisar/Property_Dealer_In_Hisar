        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for commercial office space for rent in Ashok Vihar typically ranges from 18 to 36 months although this is highly negotiable based on the size and nature of the property. The lock-in period is the duration during which neither the tenant nor the landlord can prematurely terminate the lease preventing early exit penalties.

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublease a portion of my rented office space in Ashok Vihar to another company",
        "answer": "Subleasing is entirely dependent on the specific terms stipulated in your primary lease agreement with the landlord.
