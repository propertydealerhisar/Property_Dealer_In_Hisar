    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the typical rental rates for office space on Golf Course Road",
        "answer": "Rental rates on Golf Course Road are generally among the highest in the NCR due to the Grade A infrastructure and prime location. Rates vary significantly based on the building prestige, floor level, furnishing status bare-shell vs fitted-out, and the size of the unit. Currently, premium office space for rent in Golf Course Road can range anywhere from ₹90 per sq ft to upwards of ₹150 per sq ft per month, excluding common area maintenance CAM and electricity charges. It is essential to engage a property consultant for real-time market negotiation advice."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is GCR well-connected via public transport for employees",
        "answer": "Yes, connectivity is one of the strongest selling points of this location. The Gurgaon Rapid Metro runs parallel to Golf Course Road, offering several convenient stations such as Sikanderpur, DLF Phase 1, and Sector 42-43. These stations provide direct links to the Delhi Metro network, making commuting efficient for a vast majority of the workforce who live in other parts of Delhi NCR. Bus services and shared auto-rickshaws further augment the robust transport infrastructure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration is common for commercial office space in this area",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period and lease tenure for commercial office space for rent in Golf Course Road is typically 3 years minimum. Landlords usually prefer longer leases, often extending up to 5 or 9 years, with rental escalation clauses built into the agreement. Escalation is usually fixed at 15% upon renewal or 5% annually, depending on the contract structure. Shorter leases are primarily available only in co-working or managed office environments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to pay a security deposit for office space on GCR",
        "answer": "Yes, a security deposit is universally required when renting commercial office space in Gurgaon. For properties on Golf Course Road, the typical security deposit amounts to 4 to 6 months' gross rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the lease term, provided the tenant adheres to all terms and conditions and returns the property in its original state, factoring in reasonable wear and tear."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are parking facilities adequate for large corporate tenants",
        "answer": "The Grade A commercial buildings on Golf Course Road are meticulously designed to handle high volumes of traffic and provide multi-level parking solutions. However, parking ratio allocations are usually fixed based on the total area leased e.g. 1 car space per 1000 sq ft. Tenants requiring extensive dedicated parking may need to negotiate for additional paid slots or utilize nearby public parking facilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of maintenance charges are associated with GCR properties",
        "answer": "Commercial properties on Golf Course Road require common area maintenance CAM charges, which cover services like centralized air conditioning, power backup operation, common area cleaning, security, and shared utilities. These CAM charges are usually billed separately from the base rent and can range from ₹18 to ₹30 per square foot per month, depending on the building's level of service and age."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the interior design of a rented office space",
        "answer": "If you lease a bare-shell office space, you have complete freedom to customize the design, subject to landlord and building management approvals regarding structural changes and fire safety adherence. If you rent a fitted-out unit, customization is generally limited to movable furniture and branding elements, ensuring the building's infrastructure remains intact."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which nearby areas compete with Golf Course Road for office rentals",
        "answer": "While GCR is a unique premium hub, nearby areas offering high-quality commercial office space include Cyber City DLF Phase 2, Sector 32 Institutional Area, and parts of Sohna Road. However, these locations often do not match GCR's specific combination of high-end corporate presence, seamless metro connectivity, and concentration of luxury amenities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I finalize a lease agreement on Golf Course Road",
        "answer": "The timeline depends on the complexity of the negotiation and the readiness of the property. For a standard, fitted-out office space, the process from initial inquiry to lease signing and handover can take between 4 to 8 weeks, assuming legal due diligence and agreement on commercial terms proceed smoothly. Professional assistance significantly speeds up this transition."
      },
      {
        "question": "What regulatory approvals are necessary for setting up a business here",
        "answer": "Beyond the standard company registration, businesses establishing operations in a commercial office space for rent in Golf Course Road must ensure compliance with local municipal laws, fire safety regulations, and building usage permits. If significant interior construction is planned, specific approvals from the local planning authorities and the building owner are mandatory before commencing work."
