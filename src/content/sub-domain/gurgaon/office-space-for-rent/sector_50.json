        "answer": "Lease durations in premium commercial buildings in Sector 50 typically range from three to nine years, although this can be negotiated based on your specific business requirements and the landlord's policy.

For smaller setups or serviced offices, flexible monthly or yearly contracts are available, providing excellent options for startups and temporary projects that need shorter commitments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate the total cost of renting an office space here",
        "answer": "The total cost involves more than just the base rent. You must account for maintenance charges, which cover common area electricity, security, and cleaning services, typically calculated per square foot. Additionally, operational costs include electricity consumption within your premises, property taxes if applicable, and fit-out costs for bare shell spaces. Always factor in a security deposit, usually equivalent to three to six months' rent, which is refundable at the end of the lease term pending condition checks. We provide a transparent breakdown to ensure no hidden fees."

        "answer": "Sector 50 offers a balanced mix of both furnished and unfurnished options. Fully furnished or fitted offices are popular for quick occupancy and minimal initial investment, featuring ready-to-use furniture and IT infrastructure. Conversely, many newer or larger commercial properties are offered in a bare shell condition, allowing tenants complete freedom to design and fit out the space according to their corporate branding and functional specifications. Your choice depends heavily on your budget, timeline, and desired level of customization."
      },
      {

        "answer": "The modern commercial complexes in Sector 50 are well-known for providing generous parking solutions. Tenants are typically allotted dedicated parking slots in the basement, often based on the square footage of the rented office space.

We ensure that the office space listings clearly specify the number of allocated parking spots to prevent any future inconvenience for your staff."

        "question": "What regulatory approvals are needed before moving into a rented office space",
        "answer": "Before moving in, you typically need to complete the registration of the lease agreement which formalizes the tenure and terms. If you are fitting out a bare shell space, approvals for interior design and structural alterations from the building management and sometimes local municipal authorities are required. It is essential to secure trade licenses and GST registration reflecting the new address. Our property experts guide you through all necessary documentation and liaise with landlords to expedite the approval process."

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet a portion of my office space in Sector 50 to another business",
        "answer": "The ability to sublet largely depends on the specific terms stipulated in your primary lease agreement with the property owner. Most commercial leases contain clauses that strictly restrict or prohibit subletting without the express written consent of the landlord. If subletting is a potential requirement for your business model, it is crucial to negotiate this flexibility upfront and have the approval process explicitly detailed in the final lease document to avoid any breaches of contract later on."
