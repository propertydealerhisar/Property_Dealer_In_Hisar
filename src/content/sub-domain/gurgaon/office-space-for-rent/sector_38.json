    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for Office Space For Rent in Sector 38",
        "answer": "The standard commercial lease duration in Sector 38, particularly for bare shell or large managed spaces, is typically three to five years, often accompanied by a lock-in period of 18 to 36 months depending on the extent of tenant fit-outs. For smaller serviced offices or co-working desks, much shorter and more flexible agreements, such as six to twelve months, are commonly available. We always recommend reviewing the specific lease deed carefully to understand escalation clauses and exit conditions before committing to the rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security deposits are usually required for commercial premises in this Sector",
        "answer": "Landlords generally require a security deposit equivalent to three to six months' rent when leasing a standard Office Space For Rent in Sector 38. This amount is held throughout the tenancy period and is refundable upon the satisfactory handover of the property at the end of the term, subject to any necessary deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear. Premium Grade A properties or spaces requiring extensive renovations might sometimes demand a slightly higher deposit."

These charges cover shared services like generator backup usage, centralized AC maintenance, common area cleaning, and building security. Always clarify whether your quoted rate is inclusive or exclusive of these operational costs."
      },

Customization is permitted but requires prior written approval from the landlord or building management. All proposed modifications, including structural changes, wiring layouts, and aesthetic elements, must typically adhere to the building's safety codes and municipal regulations.

        "question": "What is the standard rent escalation rate applied annually",
