    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period required for renting commercial office space in Sector 47",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for commercial rentals in Faridabad, including Sector 47, generally ranges from 18 to 36 months, depending on the size of the unit and the fit-out cost involved. For bare-shell or customised large corporate suites, landlords often request a longer lock-in commitment, sometimes up to 60 months, to secure their investment. Shorter lock-in periods might be available for smaller, fully furnished co-working or serviced office spaces, but this usually comes with a slight premium on the monthly rent. Always check the specific lease agreement details before committing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the average rental rates for Grade A office space in Sector 47 currently",
        "answer": "Rental rates for Grade A office space in Sector 47 are competitive and vary significantly based on factors such as building age, amenities offered, floor level, and furnishing status. Currently, you can expect rates to fall within the range of INR 45 to INR 75 per square foot per month for unfurnished or semi-furnished space in modern complexes. Fully furnished plug-and-play offices often command higher rates, sometimes reaching INR 80 to INR 110 per square foot, due to the minimal setup investment required by the tenant. Rates are subject to market fluctuation and negotiation dynamics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking easily available for staff and visitors in commercial buildings in Sector 47",
        "answer": "Yes, most modern commercial buildings offering office space for rent in Sector 47 provide dedicated multi-level or basement parking facilities. The standard allocation is usually one car parking spot per 1000 to 1500 square feet of leased area, although this varies by property. Visitor parking availability is also generally good but might be subject to time restrictions or a minimal fee in premium complexes. We ensure that our listings clearly outline the parking ratio and any associated costs to prevent future inconvenience for your employees."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical annual rent escalation clause in Sector 47 lease agreements",
        "answer": "Standard commercial lease agreements for office space in Sector 47 generally include an annual rent escalation clause. The typical increase percentage agreed upon is usually between 5% and 8% year-on-year, applied on the base rent. It is crucial to negotiate this figure upfront as part of your overall lease terms. We advise clients to clarify if the increase is calculated on simple interest or compounded annually, although simple interest is more common in Faridabad commercial contracts."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there good dining and retail options near the office complexes in Sector 47",
        "answer": "Sector 47 is a well-developed commercial hub that features excellent supportive infrastructure. The area boasts several nearby markets, food courts, and standalone restaurants catering to the corporate workforce. This proximity to dining and retail amenities is a major advantage, ensuring convenience for staff meals, client meetings, and essential errands throughout the workday, enhancing employee satisfaction significantly."

      },
      {
        "question": "How close is Sector 47 to major transportation hubs like the Metro Station",
        "answer": "While Sector 47 is highly accessible via road networks, its direct connectivity to the Gurgaon Metro network is currently pending the completion of planned extensions. However, the sector benefits from efficient feeder bus services and is strategically located near existing and proposed Metro routes, making connectivity highly manageable. Commuting employees rely heavily on shared transport and the well-maintained road network linking the area to key residential sectors and main city lines."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the security deposit amount when finalising my office space rental",
        "answer": "Negotiating the security deposit is often possible, especially for established companies signing longer leases or taking larger office spaces. The standard deposit is equivalent to 3 to 6 months' gross rent. If a tenant provides strong financials or commits to a very long lock-in period, landlords may sometimes agree to reduce the deposit to 2 or 3 months' rent. This is a key area where our negotiation expertise can greatly benefit prospective tenants in Sector 47."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there fully furnished and ready-to-move-in office options available in Sector 47",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Sector 47 has seen a significant rise in demand for fully furnished, plug-and-play office solutions, especially post-pandemic. These spaces are equipped with desks, chairs, cabins, networking infrastructure, and sometimes even IT support. These ready-to-move options drastically reduce the initial capital expenditure and setup time required for a new tenancy, making the transition seamless and immediate."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is typically needed to rent an office space in Sector 47 Faridabad",
        "answer": "For corporate leasing, the required documentation typically includes the Company Registration Certificate, Memorandum and Articles of Association, latest audited financial statements, PAN card of the company, and KYC documents of the authorised signatories. For startups or smaller businesses, proof of business operations and sometimes personal guarantees from directors may also be required. Ensuring all paperwork is in order accelerates the lease finalisation process considerably."
