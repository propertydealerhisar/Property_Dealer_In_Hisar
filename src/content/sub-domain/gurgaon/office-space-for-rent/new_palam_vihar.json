        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for commercial office space for rent in this Faridabad region typically ranges from 12 to 36 months, depending heavily on the size of the space and the landlord's investment in the property fit-out. Premium or fully furnished spaces often have longer lock-ins due to the high initial investment by the property owner. It is crucial to review the lease agreement carefully to understand the penalty structure if the lock-in period is broken early."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are most office spaces in New Palam Vihar fully furnished or bare shell",

However, due to high demand from growing SMEs, there is a strong supply of fully furnished and serviced office spaces that allow immediate setup.

      },
      {
        "question": "How is the rental rate calculated for commercial property here",
        "answer": "Commercial rental rates are typically quoted per square foot per month on the Super Area of the property. The final rate is influenced by factors such as the building’s age, floor level, proximity to the main road, quality of existing fit-outs, and the length of the lease commitment. We provide clear breakdowns of this rate, separating base rent from common area maintenance CAM charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is New Palam Vihar well connected by public transport for employee commuting",
        "answer": "Yes, connectivity is one of New Palam Vihar's major strengths. It offers excellent road links via major highways connecting to Gurgaon and Gurgaon. While the area is awaiting direct metro connectivity, local transport including auto-rickshaws, shared cabs, and local bus routes efficiently connect the commercial hubs to nearby residential sectors, ensuring easy commutes for your employees."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the average maintenance charges CAM and what do they cover",

In New Palam Vihar, these generally include security services, upkeep of common lobbies and washrooms, lift operations and maintenance, common area lighting, and central air conditioning maintenance if applicable. These charges are usually calculated per square foot of the leased area."
      },
      {
        "question": "What legal documents are necessary before signing a commercial lease agreement",
        "answer": "Before signing an agreement for office space for rent, ensure you receive and review the Letter of Intent LOI, the official draft Lease Agreement, copies of the landlord’s ownership documents, and relevant municipal approvals for commercial use of the premises. Legal verification of the title and adherence to RERA guidelines is always recommended before finalizing the transaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate or modify the office space after renting it",
        "answer": "Any renovation or significant modification to the leased office space usually requires prior written consent from the landlord, particularly if it involves structural changes, modifications to the HVAC systems, or alterations to the external appearance. Minor cosmetic changes like painting are often permissible but should still be clarified in the lease terms under the 'Improvements and Alterations' clause."
      },
