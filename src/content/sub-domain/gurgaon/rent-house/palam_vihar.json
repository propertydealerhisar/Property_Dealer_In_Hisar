      {
        "question": "What should I look for in the lease agreement before signing to rent a house in Palam Vihar",
        "answer": "Always scrutinize clauses related to maintenance responsibility which specifies who pays for minor repairs versus structural issues. Confirm the rent escalation percentage for renewal which is typically 5 to 10 percent annually. Verify the details regarding the security deposit refund process and the conditions for deductions. Ensure that all included fixtures and fittings are accurately documented in the agreement to prevent future disputes with the landlord or property manager."
      },

High-rise societies might have stricter rules sometimes prohibiting larger breeds. Always confirm the pet policy upfront in writing before moving in to avoid complications later."
