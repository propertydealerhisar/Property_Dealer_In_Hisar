    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for a house rental in Sector 6",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Sector 6 usually ranges from two to three months of the agreed-upon rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of the lease, assuming the property is returned in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and tear. Specific luxury properties or fully furnished homes might require a slightly higher deposit, which will be clearly outlined in your rental agreement documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 6 typically available as fully furnished units",
        "answer": "While semi-furnished and unfurnished options are more common in the independent house segment of Sector 6, fully furnished luxury kothis are also available, catering to the corporate and expatriate market. If you require a fully furnished rental, it is essential to specify this requirement early in your search to narrow down the available high-end properties that meet those standards."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close is Sector 6 Gurgaon to the nearest Metro Station",
        "answer": "Sector 6 does not have its own dedicated Metro station immediately adjacent, but it benefits from excellent road connectivity to the nearest stops on the Yellow Line, such as the MG Road Metro Station or Huda City Centre. Travel time via auto-rickshaw or personal vehicle is typically short, providing convenient access to the entire NCR Metro network for commuters."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration is common for renting a house in Sector 6",
        "answer": "The most common lease duration for independent houses and builder floors in Sector 6 is 11 months, renewable thereafter. Longer leases, such as 18 or 24 months, can often be negotiated, particularly for stable tenants and larger properties, providing greater security and predictability for both parties."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I find houses with dedicated parking when I rent house in Sector 6",
        "answer": "Yes, one of the significant advantages of renting an independent house or kothi in Sector 6 is the inclusion of dedicated, often covered, parking spaces. Unlike many congested apartment complexes, these properties typically offer space for one or more cars, ensuring the safety and convenience of your vehicle."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the average maintenance charges for rental homes here",
        "answer": "Maintenance charges for independent houses in Sector 6 vary greatly depending on whether the property is a standalone unit or part of a gated colony. Standalone properties usually incur utility bills directly, while colony houses may have a small monthly fee covering common area cleaning, security, and sometimes water supply. These charges are usually managed by the tenant or RWA."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 6 considered a safe area for families with young children",

The community is generally peaceful and secure, making it highly suitable for families seeking a safe environment for their children to grow up."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses in Sector 6",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by the property owner in Sector 6. Since you are renting independent homes, there is generally a greater chance of securing permission for pets compared to apartment complexes. However, this must be explicitly agreed upon and documented in the lease agreement before moving in to avoid future complications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main advantages of renting a builder floor versus a full kothi",
        "answer": "Renting a builder floor in Sector 6 offers a more cost-effective solution with shared land costs and lower utility bills compared to a full kothi. Builder floors provide substantial living space and independence while kothis offer maximum privacy, larger outdoor areas, and often luxury finishes and servant accommodation, reflecting a significantly higher rental price point."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I finalize a rental agreement for a house in this sector",
        "answer": "If all documentation is ready and the agreement terms are mutually accepted, the process can be finalized within 3 to 7 working days. Our streamlined process ensures efficient background checks and legal paperwork completion so you can move into your new house for rent in Sector 6 Gurgaon without undue delay."
