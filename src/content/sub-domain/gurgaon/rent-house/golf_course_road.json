      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is required for a rental house in this area",
        "answer": "Due to the high value of properties and furnishings in this upscale location, the standard security deposit often ranges from three to six months' rent. This deposit is refundable upon the satisfactory handover of the property at the end of the tenancy, subject to deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear. Specific amounts depend on whether the house is furnished or unfurnished."

This is always detailed precisely within the rental agreement clauses."
