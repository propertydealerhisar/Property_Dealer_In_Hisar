    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required when I Rent House in Sector 68",
        "answer": "In Sector 68 Gurgaon, the standard security deposit for independent houses usually ranges from two to three months' rent. This deposit is refundable upon the end of the lease, provided the property is returned without major damages beyond normal wear and tear. It is crucial to read your lease agreement carefully to understand the exact conditions for deposit return and any applicable deductions before signing the tenancy contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 68 generally furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "The available rental houses in Sector 68 are found in all three states unfurnished, semi-furnished, and fully furnished. Unfurnished homes are the most common, while semi-furnished options often include modular kitchen fittings, wardrobes, and basic lighting. Fully furnished luxury villas are available but typically command a significantly higher rental price. We specify the furnishing status clearly in all our property listings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the average utility costs associated with renting an independent house here",
        "answer": "Utility costs in an independent house include electricity, water, and gas charges, which are generally borne by the tenant in addition to the rent. Electricity costs depend entirely on consumption, water usage is often regulated through borewells or tanker supply at a variable rate, and gas is usually through piped connections or cylinders. Because there is no society common area maintenance, your utility bills are solely based on your household usage."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the typical lease agreement duration for houses in Sector 68",
        "answer": "Most landlords in Sector 68 prefer a standard lease agreement of 11 months, which is then renewable upon mutual agreement. Longer leases, such as 18 months or two years, can be negotiated, especially for corporate leases or high-value luxury rentals. A written agreement is legally essential, detailing rent escalation clauses and notice periods."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the policy regarding pets in independent house rentals in this area",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by each property owner. While apartments often have strict society rules against pets, independent house owners are generally more lenient. However, you must always disclose the type and size of your pet upfront to ensure written permission is included in your lease to avoid potential conflicts later in your tenancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is maintenance typically handled by the landlord or the tenant",
        "answer": "For independent houses, minor maintenance issues such as bulb replacements or basic plumbing fixes are usually the tenant's responsibility. The landlord is typically responsible for structural repairs, major electrical system faults, or issues arising from building defects. Clear demarcation of responsibilities is always outlined in the tenancy agreement to prevent confusion."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the best way to determine a fair rental price for a property",
        "answer": "A fair rental price is determined by several factors including the house size, quality of interiors, age of the construction, and proximity to the main road or amenities. We provide comparative market analysis based on recent local transactions to ensure you are paying a competitive rate when you Rent House in Sector 68."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific safety concerns renters should be aware of in Sector 68 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Sector 68 is generally considered safe and well-regulated due to its proximity to major roads and planned development. However, like any urban area, tenants should ensure the house has adequate security features like reinforced doors, quality locks, and potentially a local security guard if not within a gated colony for enhanced safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate or make minor modifications to the house I rent",
        "answer": "Minor decorative changes like painting certain walls or hanging pictures are often permitted but should always be discussed with the landlord first. Major structural modifications or permanent changes are almost always prohibited unless explicitly agreed upon in writing, usually with the understanding that the property must be restored to its original state upon vacating."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is water and electricity supply generally managed for independent houses in Sector 68",
        "answer": "Many houses rely on a combination of government supply and private borewell systems for water, often supplemented by large overhead tanks. Electricity is usually provided reliably through the state board. Tenants should inquire about backup power solutions such as inverters or generators, as these are common features in independent homes for uninterrupted living."
