    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental cost range for an independent floor in Sector 42",
        "answer": "The rental price for an independent floor in Sector 42 varies significantly based on size, the floor level, furnishing status, and proximity to Golf Course Road. Generally, you can expect rents to start from approximately INR 45,000 per month for a smaller, unfurnished 2 BHK builder floor, escalating up to INR 1 50,000 or more for a large, fully furnished 4 BHK floor or ground floor unit with a private garden. Premium independent houses and villas will command significantly higher rates."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are most rental houses in Sector 42 fully furnished partially furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "Sector 42 offers a mix of all three options but the predominant listings are either unfurnished or partially furnished houses. Unfurnished units provide tenants with maximum flexibility for interior design. Partially furnished typically includes modular kitchens, wardrobes, and air conditioning units. Fully furnished luxury villas and serviced apartments are available but often targeted towards corporate leases and come at a higher premium rental cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of security provisions are standard in Sector 42 rental properties",
        "answer": "Given the high-profile nature of the sector, security is generally excellent. Most independent houses and builder floors are located within gated residential colonies with boom barriers and 24/7 manned security guards. Individual houses usually feature CCTV systems, secure boundary walls, and intercom facilities. Always inquire about additional security features like biometric access or video door phones when you view a property."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the typical lease agreement period in Sector 42 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "The standard lease period for residential rentals in Sector 42 is 11 months, which is renewable. However, due to the high demand for stability from both landlords and tenants, many agreements are drafted for a full 12-month period with a lock-in clause typically of 6 months. Corporate leases or high-value villa rentals often opt for longer agreements, sometimes spanning 24 to 36 months, to ensure long-term stability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 42 well-connected by public transport like the Metro",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 42 boasts superb connectivity. It is exceptionally close to the Sector 42-43 Rapid Metro Station providing easy access to the rest of the city and DLF Cyber City. Furthermore, the robust road network, including direct access to Golf Course Road, ensures quick availability of taxis and ride-sharing services, making daily commuting very convenient for residents."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common maintenance charges when I rent house in Sector 42",
        "answer": "Maintenance charges vary greatly depending on the type of property. For builder floors or independent houses within a gated colony, maintenance covers common area lighting, security, gardening in shared spaces, and sometimes power backup fuel costs. These can range from INR 3,000 to INR 10,000 per month. If renting a full villa, the tenant is usually responsible for all internal and external maintenance including generator upkeep and private garden care."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses in Sector 42",
        "answer": "Pet policies are strictly determined by the individual landlord or the RWA Residents' Welfare Association of the specific colony. Since many properties are independent houses, pet permission is often more likely than in high-rise apartments, but this is never guaranteed. Always disclose pet ownership upfront and ensure the pet clause is explicitly included in the rental agreement to avoid future conflicts."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required from tenants to finalize a rental agreement",
        "answer": "Landlords typically require comprehensive documentation including proof of identity such as Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of current address, and employment verification often in the form of a company ID or employment letter. For expatriates, a valid visa and residential permit are mandatory. Detailed documentation ensures a smooth background check process for both parties involved."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking easily available for tenants in Sector 42 rental homes",
        "answer": "Parking availability is a major advantage of renting in Sector 42, especially compared to denser areas of Gurgaon. Independent floors and builder floors almost always offer dedicated covered parking slots, usually 1 to 2 spaces per unit. Luxury villas and bungalows typically provide private driveways and multi-car parking space inside the property compound ensuring convenient and secure vehicle storage."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utility costs should a tenant budget for in addition to the monthly rent",
        "answer": "In Sector 42, tenants are responsible for their individual consumption of electricity, water usage charges often paid to the RWA or local authority, piped gas if available, and internet/DTH services. Utility costs can vary based on consumption habits and the use of air conditioning. Tenants should also factor in the cost of diesel for running the power backup generator during extended outages."
