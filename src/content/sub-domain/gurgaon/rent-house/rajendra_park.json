    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the typical rental rates for a 3BHK house in Rajendra Park Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Rates vary significantly based on whether you choose a builder floor or a fully independent Kothi and its proximity to major roads. Generally, a semi-furnished 3BHK builder floor starts around ₹18,000 to ₹25,000 per month, while a newly constructed or larger independent house might command ₹30,000 and upwards. Factors like dedicated parking, power backup availability, and furnishing level directly influence the final agreed rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Rajendra Park considered a safe and family-friendly locality for renters",
        "answer": "Yes, Rajendra Park is highly regarded as a safe and established residential zone in Gurgaon. It benefits from active Resident Welfare Associations and local police patrolling. The environment is quieter than core commercial sectors, and the availability of open parks and well-maintained local amenities makes it particularly attractive to families with young children or elderly residents seeking a peaceful living space."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease term required when I rent a house here",
        "answer": "The standard residential lease agreement in this part of Gurgaon is typically 11 months, which is automatically renewable upon mutual agreement. Some landlords may offer a full 12-month or longer lease if you are willing to commit upfront, often providing a slightly better rental rate or terms. Always ensure the lock-in period, if any, is clearly defined in the written agreement before you finalize your decision to rent house in Rajendra Park."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close is Rajendra Park to the nearest Metro Station and major offices",
        "answer": "Rajendra Park enjoys excellent metro connectivity, often being a short drive or an accessible auto-rickshaw ride away from the nearest operational stations like Dwarka Sector 21 or potentially the upcoming sector connections. For major offices in Udyog Vihar and Cyber City, the drive time is generally manageable, ranging from 15 to 30 minutes depending on peak traffic conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to pay a brokerage fee to secure a rental house in Rajendra Park",
        "answer": "Typically, yes. Most professional real estate services charge a standard brokerage fee, which usually amounts to one month’s rent plus GST upon the successful signing of the lease agreement. Our service ensures that this fee covers comprehensive support, including background checks, documentation assistance, and key handover, streamlining your rental experience."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses for rent in Rajendra Park usually furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "Rajendra Park offers a mix. Most builder floors and smaller independent units are typically semi-furnished, meaning they include basic fittings like modular kitchens, wardrobes, fans, and light fixtures. Fully furnished options are available, but they are fewer in number and command a significantly higher rental premium due to the inclusion of furniture, appliances, and white goods."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utilities am I responsible for paying as a tenant in Rajendra Park",
        "answer": "As a tenant, you are usually responsible for all running consumption costs. This includes electricity consumption based on a separate meter, water charges (which might be fixed or metered), DTH or internet bills, and gas connection charges. Maintenance fees might be included in the rent or charged separately depending on the landlord's agreement structure for the Rent House in Rajendra Park."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a house in Rajendra Park if I have pets",
        "answer": "Finding pet-friendly houses can be challenging but not impossible in Rajendra Park. Independent house owners are often more amenable to pets than society apartments. It is crucial to be upfront about your pets during the initial inquiry. Be prepared to offer a slightly higher security deposit or sign specific clauses regarding property damage caused by the animals."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do I need to prepare before applying for a rental lease",
        "answer": "Landlords typically require standard KYC documents including Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and proof of current employment or business registration. For salaried individuals, the last three months' salary slips or bank statements may also be requested to verify financial stability and capacity to pay the Rent House in Rajendra Park."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a house once the lease is finalized",
        "answer": "If the property is vacant and move-in ready, the process can be very quick, often within 24 to 48 hours of lease signing and security deposit transfer. The main factor determining speed is usually the time taken to complete the necessary background checks and stamp the official rental agreement paper."
