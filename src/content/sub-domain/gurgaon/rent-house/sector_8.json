    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period when I rent house in Sector 8",
        "answer": "Most landlords in Sector 8, particularly for independent houses and builder floors, require a minimum lock-in period of six months. This means neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the lease agreement during this initial period. The standard lease duration is 11 months, renewable thereafter, but always confirm the specific lock-in clause before signing your agreement to avoid potential penalties."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 8 generally furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "The majority of independent houses and kothis available for rent in Sector 8 are offered unfurnished or semi-furnished. Unfurnished typically includes basic fixtures and fittings. Semi-furnished might include wardrobes, AC units, geysers, and sometimes modular kitchen setup. Fully furnished options exist, but they are less common and typically command a significantly higher rental price."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security deposit is usually required for Sector 8 rentals",
        "answer": "The standard practice for residential rentals in Sector 8 Gurgaon is requiring a security deposit equivalent to two months of rent. However, for premium or larger properties, landlords might request up to three months’ rent as a refundable security deposit. This deposit is returned to the tenant upon the successful termination of the lease, provided there is no damage to the property."
      },
      {
        "question": "How old are the independent houses available to rent in Sector 8",
        "answer": "Sector 8 is an older, established sector, so the houses here vary significantly in age. You will find older, traditional kothis constructed 20 to 30 years ago, alongside newly built low-rise builder floors that are less than five years old. It is essential to check the age and recent renovation status of the house to ensure it meets your maintenance expectations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 8 considered a safe residential locality in Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 8 is widely considered a safe and secure residential locality. It benefits from established residential communities and generally high occupancy rates. Many independent houses have their own dedicated boundary walls and secured entrances. Furthermore, local police presence is steady, contributing to the overall security and peace of mind for residents."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common utility costs when renting a house here",
        "answer": "Common utility costs typically include electricity, water, and gas. Electricity is generally metered and paid based on consumption. Water supply is usually stable, and charges may be included in the maintenance fee or paid separately to the local authority. Independent houses often require separate payment for borewell water if not connected to the main municipal line."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I easily find parking when I rent house in Sector 8",
        "answer": "Unlike high-rise apartments, independent houses and kothis often come with dedicated, covered parking space within the premises, usually for one or two cars. For builder floors or smaller plots, street parking is common but generally less congested than in newer areas. Always verify the availability of dedicated parking when inspecting a property."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in rental houses in this sector",
        "answer": "Pet policies are highly dependent on the individual landlord. Since Sector 8 primarily features independent houses, there is a higher chance of negotiating pet allowance compared to strict apartment complexes. However, this must be explicitly discussed and written into the lease agreement before moving in to avoid future disputes with the property owner."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental escalation rate for renewal in Sector 8",
        "answer": "The standard rental escalation rate upon renewal of an 11-month lease agreement in Sector 8 is usually between 5% and 10%. This rate is negotiable but depends largely on market conditions and the demand for the specific type of property. Ensure the agreed-upon escalation rate is clearly stipulated in the initial rental contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "How far is Sector 8 from the main Cyber City business hub",
        "answer": "Sector 8 is located strategically in Old Gurgaon. Depending on traffic, commuting to major business hubs like Cyber City or Udyog Vihar typically takes 25 to 40 minutes via the internal roads or the NH-48 access point.
