A standard 2 BHK apartment in a high-rise society usually ranges from INR 18,000 to INR 25,000 per month. Larger 3 BHK and 4 BHK units often fall between INR 28,000 and INR 45,000.

Location within the sector and proximity to main roads also influence the final price, so it is important to check the latest market rates before finalizing your agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the standard lease agreement period when I rent a house here",
        "answer": "The customary and most common lease duration in Sector 92 Gurgaon, like most of New Gurgaon, is twelve months. Landlords prefer this stability. However, tenants are often required to give one or two months' notice before vacating the property even if the lease is shorter. While short-term leases (six months) might occasionally be negotiated, they typically come with a higher monthly rental premium. Always ensure your lease clearly specifies renewal terms and notice periods."

      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in the residential societies and independent houses in this area",

If you have pets, it is crucial to explicitly confirm the pet policy in writing before signing any lease agreement to avoid future disputes or complications."

Society maintenance charges are sometimes included in the rent, particularly in high-end properties, but often these are also borne by the tenant. Always clarify which utility bills and maintenance charges are your responsibility before finalizing the rental agreement amount."
      },
