      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is typically required for a rental house",
        "answer": "The customary security deposit in New Gurgaon usually ranges from two to three months' worth of the agreed-upon rent.

        "question": "Can I rent an independent house in New Gurgaon if I am a bachelor or student",
        "answer": "While New Gurgaon is largely family-oriented, several builder floors and independent houses in specific sectors are open to bachelors or working professionals.

If a tenant breaks the lock-in period, they often forfeit the security deposit or a portion thereof. Always read this clause carefully before committing to rent house in New Gurgaon."

        "answer": "You will need valid photo identification such as an Aadhar card or passport, proof of current address, and possibly employment verification or the company ID card if the lease is corporate. Additionally, ensure you have bank details ready for the security deposit and first month's rent payment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price when looking at houses in New Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is a standard part of the rental process, especially during periods of high inventory.
