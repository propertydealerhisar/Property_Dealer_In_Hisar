    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required when I rent house in South City 1 Gurgaon?",
        "answer": "The standard practice in Gurgaon, including premium sectors like South City 1, is to request a security deposit equivalent to two or three months' rent. This deposit is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy period, provided the property is returned in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and tear. Always ensure the lease agreement clearly specifies the deposit amount, the conditions for its return, and the legally stipulated timeframe for the refund process upon vacating the premises to prevent disputes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses for rent in South City 1 usually furnished or unfurnished?",
        "answer": "South City 1 offers a balanced mix of furnishing options tailored to tenant needs. While builder floors often come semi-furnished with essential features like modular kitchens, fitted wardrobes, and basic fittings, larger independent houses and villas frequently offer semi-furnished or completely unfurnished options. This allows tenants greater freedom to furnish according to their personal taste. Fully furnished high-end villas are available but typically command a higher premium rental rate reflecting the comprehensive move-in readiness and luxury fittings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease term is standard for residential properties in South City 1?",
        "answer": "The most common lease duration in South City 1 for residential houses is 11 months, which is registered under an agreement and is renewable upon mutual agreement between the landlord and tenant. Some landlords, especially for high-value properties or corporate leases, prefer longer terms, such as 18 or 24 months, offering greater stability for both parties. It is essential your contract details the notice period required for early termination, which is typically stipulated as one or two months."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are utility bills managed when renting an independent house in this area?",
        "answer": "In almost all rental agreements for independent houses in South City 1, the tenant is explicitly responsible for paying all running utility bills. This includes electricity consumption, municipal water charges, piped gas usage, and charges for external services like internet and cable television directly to the providers. The landlord usually ensures all meters are functional and legally registered. It is crucial for both parties to take verifiable meter readings on the day you move in and move out to accurately settle consumption charges."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is South City 1 a good area for families with young children considering schools?",
        "answer": "Absolutely South City 1 is highly favoured by families due to its strategic location near some of Gurgaon's best educational institutions, making the morning school run very manageable. Top schools like Presidium School, DPS Sushant Lok, and Amity International School are within a short commuting distance. Furthermore, the area’s abundant, well-maintained parks and safe, low-traffic internal roads make it exceptionally conducive for family life and child safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of maintenance responsibilities fall to the tenant versus the landlord?",
        "answer": "Generally, the tenant is responsible for minor day-to-day maintenance tasks like replacing light bulbs, maintaining household cleanliness, clearing blockages, and repairing minor breakages caused by use. The landlord typically covers major structural repairs, major faults in the plumbing and electrical systems, and external property maintenance like painting or roof repairs. The detailed lease agreement should clearly define the scope of maintenance responsibilities to prevent any future disagreements."
      },

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I keep pets if I decide to rent a house in South City 1?",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among landlords, particularly concerning independent houses where rules are often set individually rather than by an RWA. While some landlords are strictly against pets due to potential property damage, many are accommodating, especially for well-behaved pets in independent villas or ground-floor units. Always secure explicit written permission from the landlord regarding your specific pet before signing the lease to avoid any future legal complications or potential breaches of contract terms."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the average rental rates for a standard 3 BHK house in South City 1?",
