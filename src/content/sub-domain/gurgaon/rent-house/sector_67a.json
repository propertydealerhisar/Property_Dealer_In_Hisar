        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for rental agreements in Sector 67A is usually six months. During this time, neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the agreement without incurring a penalty, which is often equivalent to two months' rent. After the lock-in period, a standard notice period of one to two months is typically required for termination."
      },

        "question": "How much security deposit is generally required for independent house rentals here",
        "answer": "For independent houses and villas in Sector 67A, the security deposit typically ranges from two to four months' equivalent rent. For high-end, fully-furnished properties, the deposit might be closer to four months. This amount is refundable upon the satisfactory termination of the lease, minus any charges for damages beyond normal wear and tear."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in independent houses for rent in Sector 67A Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Whether pets are allowed depends entirely on the individual landlord’s preference and the specific rules of the residential society, if applicable. While independent houses generally offer more flexibility than apartments, it is crucial to clarify pet policy upfront and have it explicitly documented in the lease agreement to avoid future disputes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation do I need to prepare to secure a rental property quickly",
        "answer": "To secure a house rental efficiently, you should have ready copies of your Aadhar Card, PAN Card, proof of employment or business registration, and bank statements for the last three months. Expatriates will also need a valid visa, passport, and company letter. Quick preparation of these documents ensures swift processing of the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for property maintenance in a rented independent house",
        "answer": "Generally, the landlord is responsible for structural repairs and major appliance replacements not caused by tenant misuse. The tenant is typically responsible for day-to-day minor maintenance like cleaning, electrical faults, plumbing blockages, and garden upkeep, unless otherwise specified in the lease document."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking available with most independent houses in Sector 67A",
        "answer": "Yes, nearly all independent houses and villas listed for rent in Sector 67A come with dedicated parking space, usually within the plot boundary or covered stilt area. We recommend verifying the number of covered and open parking slots available for each property if you have multiple vehicles."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common lease durations offered in this sector",
        "answer": "The most common and preferred lease duration for residential properties in Sector 67A is 11 months, renewable thereafter.

      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate the total cost for moving into a rental house in Sector 67A",
        "answer": "The initial move-in cost typically involves paying the first month's rent in advance, the security deposit (2-4 months' rent), and potentially a brokerage fee (usually equivalent to one month's rent, which is shared between the tenant and landlord, or sometimes borne entirely by one party). Budget for utility connection charges as well."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the houses in Sector 67A located within gated colonies or independent plots",
        "answer": "Sector 67A features a mix of both. Many premium independent houses and villas are situated within secure, large gated residential communities offering superior shared amenities and security. Other independent plots might stand alone but usually feature their own private boundary walls and dedicated security arrangements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical annual rent escalation rate expected",
        "answer": "The standard annual rent escalation rate for renewal in Sector 67A properties ranges between 5 percent and 10 percent.
