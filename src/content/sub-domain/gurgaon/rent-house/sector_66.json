        "answer": "Typically, landlords in Sector 66 require a security deposit equivalent to two or three months' rent, depending on the property type and furnishing level. For luxury villas or highly furnished apartments, this amount might occasionally be higher, perhaps up to four months' rent. This deposit is usually refundable upon the lease expiry, provided the tenant hands over the property in good condition, allowing for standard wear and tear. It is crucial to clarify the exact terms regarding deposit refund conditions, interest accrual, and deductions for damages during the lease agreement finalization to ensure transparency."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there fully furnished rental houses available in Sector 66 and what do they include",

For high-end gated communities, expect charges between ₹4,000 and ₹10,000 per month for a 3 BHK unit. These charges usually cover common area electricity, lift maintenance, security services, garbage disposal, and upkeep of shared facilities like the gym and swimming pool. It is essential to confirm whether the landlord includes maintenance in the rent or if the tenant must pay the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) directly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the minimum lock-in period for a rent house agreement in Sector 66 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "The standard rental agreement in Sector 66 typically spans 11 months, which is legally renewable. However, most landlords enforce a minimum lock-in period of 6 months.

Always negotiate and clearly specify the lock-in clause before you commit to rent house in Sector 66."

      {
        "question": "How is the water and electricity supply infrastructure in Sector 66",

Electricity supply is stable, often supplemented by 100% power backup provided by generators in most residential complexes, ensuring uninterrupted power.

        "question": "What documentation is required from tenants when securing a house for rent",

For non-Indian residents, passport and visa copies are mandatory. A valid rent agreement registration is also required by law, usually shared 50/50 between the tenant and the landlord to comply with local regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a house in Sector 66 if I have pets",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among property owners and residential societies in Sector 66. While some independent houses are naturally more pet-friendly, many high-rise apartment complexes have strict rules or outright bans on specific types of pets.

        "answer": "Standard real estate practice in Gurgaon dictates an annual rent escalation of 5% to 10% upon the renewal of the lease agreement. The exact percentage is often influenced by current market demand and inflation rates. This rate should be clearly specified and agreed upon in the initial rent agreement to prevent misunderstandings upon subsequent renewals of your Sector 66 house rental.
