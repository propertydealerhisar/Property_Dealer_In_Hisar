      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 45 usually furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "You will find a mix of options when you rent house in Sector 45. The majority of independent houses are offered as semi-furnished, meaning they include essential permanent fixtures like modular kitchens, wardrobes, and basic electrical fittings. Fully furnished options are available, catering primarily to expatriates or those seeking immediate occupancy without purchasing furniture, but these typically command a higher premium."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration when renting property in this sector",
        "answer": "The standard lease agreement duration for residential rentals in Sector 45 is 11 months, which is renewable. Some landlords may agree to a full 12-month or longer contract, particularly for corporate leases or high-value properties, but the 11-month agreement is preferred legally to avoid certain registration hassles. Always ensure the renewal clause and notice period are clearly defined."

      {
        "question": "What security deposit amount is required for rentals here",
        "answer": "In Sector 45 and most of Gurgaon, the standard security deposit required is equivalent to two months' rent. However, for fully furnished or premium independent houses, landlords may request three months' rent as security. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy after deducting any necessary repairs or outstanding dues."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for house maintenance in an independent rental unit",
        "answer": "Typically, the tenant is responsible for day-to-day minor repairs and utility maintenance, often defined as costs under a certain amount, for instance, less than Rupees 2000. Major structural repairs, exterior painting, or fixing issues related to plumbing or electrical wiring outside the unit are generally the landlord's responsibility. The specific terms are always outlined clearly in the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in independent houses in Sector 45",
        "answer": "Pet policies are decided solely by the individual homeowner when renting an independent house. Many landlords are more flexible with pets in independent homes compared to apartment complexes.

Additionally, there might be a nominal monthly or annual maintenance fee if the house is part of a managed gated residential cluster, though this is less common for purely independent plots."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to finalize a rental agreement in Sector 45 Gurgaon",

The tenant usually needs a government-issued photo ID such as Aadhar Card or Passport, PAN Card, and possibly employment proof or bank statements. The landlord must provide property ownership documents and proof of identity. The agreement itself must be notarized or registered for full legal validity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price for an independent house",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is generally possible in the Gurgaon rental market, especially for independent houses.
