        "question": "What is the typical process for finding and finalizing a rental house in this sector",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there suitable options for pet owners looking to rent house in Sector 112",
        "answer": "Yes, finding a rental property that allows pets is generally much easier in independent houses and villas than it is within strict high-rise society apartments. Since independent houses often feature private yards or direct access to the outdoors, many landlords are more receptive to responsible pet owners. It remains crucial, however, to disclose pet ownership early during the negotiation stage."
