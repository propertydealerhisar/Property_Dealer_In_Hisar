    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required when I rent a house in Sector 94",
        "answer": "Standard practice in Sector 94, much like the rest of Gurgaon, dictates that the security deposit is equivalent to two months of rent. However, this is negotiable depending on the landlord, the house specifications, and whether the unit is furnished or semi-furnished. Always ensure the deposit terms and refund clauses are clearly documented in the rental agreement before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 94 generally furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "The majority of independent houses and builder floors available for rent in Sector 94 Gurgaon are offered in a semi-furnished condition. This usually includes basic fixtures like fans, lights, geysers, and modular kitchen setups. Fully furnished units are less common but are available at a premium price point, often targeting expatriates or corporate leases."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lock-in period for rental agreements in this area",
        "answer": "Most landlords prefer a minimum lock-in period of 6 to 12 months when renting a house in Sector 94. During this period, neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the agreement without incurring a penalty. We advise tenants to carefully review the exit clauses related to early termination before finalizing the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is water and electricity supply managed in independent rental houses in Sector 94",
        "answer": "Independent houses typically require tenants to manage their utility connections directly. Electricity is usually metered separately and billed according to Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam HVPNL rates. Water supply is generally reliable, often supplemented by bores or tankers, though charges for auxiliary water sources might apply based on the specific property."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 94 Gurgaon safe for families and working professionals",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 94 is considered a relatively safe and developing sector. The area features broad roads and many of the independent colonies have their own dedicated security personnel. Its proximity to established residential sectors also contributes to a stable and secure neighborhood environment suitable for families."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a broker to find a good rental house in Sector 94",
        "answer": "While you can attempt to find listings directly, using a professional local real estate agent specializing in Sector 94 rentals is highly recommended. They provide access to verified, exclusive listings, handle the complex negotiation process, and ensure all legal documentation is correctly executed according to Gurgaon tenancy laws."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are needed to finalize a house rental agreement here",
        "answer": "Tenants typically need to provide Aadhar card proof of identity and address, PAN card copy, recent photographs, and, for salaried individuals, proof of current employment or salary slips. Foreign nationals require a valid passport and visa documentation for verification purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in independent houses available for rent in Sector 94",
        "answer": "Allowing pets is entirely at the discretion of the individual landlord when renting an independent house. Since these properties offer more privacy than apartments, many landlords are flexible, provided a pet clause is included in the lease detailing responsibility for any potential damages or excessive noise."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a rental property after finalizing the agreement",
        "answer": "Once the rent and security deposit are transferred and the lease agreement is signed and notarized, tenants can usually move in immediately. The typical timeline from first viewing to moving in for a house in Sector 94 ranges from 3 to 7 days, assuming all documentation is ready."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the key maintenance responsibilities for the tenant versus the landlord",
        "answer": "Generally, the landlord is responsible for major structural repairs, plumbing leaks, and electrical wiring issues outside the unit. The tenant is usually responsible for minor repairs, regular cleaning, bulb replacements, and routine maintenance of appliances provided by the owner. Always clarify specific responsibilities in the contract."
