    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for independent houses available to rent house in Sector 65",
        "answer": "Standard residential lease agreements in Sector 65 are typically set for 11 months, which is renewable upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord. Longer leases, such as 24 months, are sometimes negotiated for high-value properties or corporate rentals, often including a lock-in period. We always advise clients to clearly understand the renewal clause and notice period requirements specified in the final rent agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the standard security deposit requirements in Sector 65 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "For independent houses and builder floors in Sector 65, the standard security deposit usually ranges from two to three months of the agreed-upon monthly rent. This amount is refundable at the end of the tenancy after deductions for any damages beyond normal wear and tear or outstanding utility bills. The specific amount often depends on the property value and whether the house is furnished."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do independent houses for rent in Sector 65 typically include power backup facilities",
        "answer": "Yes, modern independent houses and builder floors, especially those constructed recently, usually include provisions for partial or full power backup, often via generators or inverter systems. Given Gurgaon's reliance on air conditioning, reliable power backup is a common expectation for tenants looking to rent house in Sector 65. Always confirm the capacity of the backup system before finalizing the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in independent rental houses in this Gurgaon area",
        "answer": "Pet policies are entirely at the discretion of the individual landlord when you rent house in Sector 65. While independent houses generally offer more flexibility than apartment societies, it is essential to disclose ownership of pets immediately. Some landlords may require an additional pet deposit or a specific clause detailing responsibility for pet-related damages to the property."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for minor repairs and routine maintenance when renting a house",
        "answer": "Generally, the tenant is responsible for day-to-day minor maintenance and wear and tear, such as replacing light bulbs, maintaining the garden (if applicable), and minor plumbing issues up to a certain cost threshold agreed upon in the lease. The landlord typically covers major structural repairs, electrical system failures, and severe plumbing breakdowns."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the negotiation process work when settling on the final rental price in Sector 65",
        "answer": "Rental prices are negotiable, depending heavily on the demand, the furnishing level, and the duration of the proposed lease. Our agents assist by providing comparable market rates for independent house rentals in Sector 65 to support your offer. Being prepared with reference letters and offering a longer lease term can strengthen your negotiating position significantly, often resulting in favorable rent terms."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a house rental agreement in Sector 65",
        "answer": "Key documents required typically include a valid government-issued photo ID (Aadhar Card or Passport), PAN Card, proof of current employment or business, and sometimes bank statements or salary slips. For expatriates, a valid visa and employment contract are mandatory. Both the tenant and the landlord must provide necessary identification proof for the legal registration of the rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it better to rent a furnished or unfurnished house in Sector 65 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "The choice depends on your duration of stay and personal assets. Furnished homes are convenient for short-term stays or professionals relocating internationally, but they carry a higher monthly rent. Unfurnished homes offer greater cost savings and the ability to customize your space, making them ideal for long-term residents planning to rent house in Sector 65."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical monthly fixed costs beyond the basic rent in this locality",
        "answer": "Beyond the rent, tenants must typically budget for utility costs like electricity, water, and gas, which are usage-based. Additionally, if the house is part of a gated community, a monthly maintenance charge for common area services and security may apply. Cable, internet, and sometimes basic municipal taxes are also the tenant’s responsibility depending on specific lease terms."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I efficiently view multiple independent houses to rent house in Sector 65 without wasting time",
