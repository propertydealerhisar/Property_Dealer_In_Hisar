This amount is refundable upon the satisfactory handover of the property at the end of the lease, provided there are no damages beyond normal wear and tear. It is crucial to clarify the exact amount and the conditions for refund in the rental agreement before finalizing the deal. Premium or fully furnished properties might sometimes require a slightly higher deposit, possibly up to four months' rent."

        "question": "What are the standard lease durations for independent houses here",
        "answer": "The most common lease duration when you rent house in Sector 67 is 11 months, renewable thereafter. However, property owners generally prefer longer lock-in periods, particularly for high-value independent houses and villas. It is often possible to negotiate a 12-month or even a 24-month lease agreement, especially if you commit to a nominal rent escalation after the first year. Ensure your agreement clearly specifies notice periods and exit clauses for both parties."

      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 67 pet-friendly",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly from one landlord to another, especially in independent house rentals. While some landlords are strictly against pets due to potential damage, many independent house owners in Sector 67 are more flexible than large apartment societies, particularly if the property has a private garden or terrace area. It is vital to discuss your pet requirements openly with the property owner or agent upfront, as disclosing this early can prevent lease complications later. Expect to pay a slightly higher security deposit if pets are permitted."

      },
      {
        "question": "How is the maintenance handled for rental properties in Sector 67",
        "answer": "For independent builder floors or houses, external structural maintenance and common area upkeep (if applicable) are usually the responsibility of the landlord or the Resident Welfare Association RWA. Internal maintenance, general wear and tear, and immediate minor repairs like electrical faults or plumbing issues typically fall to the tenant. It is crucial for the rental agreement to explicitly detail which party is responsible for major appliance repairs and structural defects to avoid future disputes."
      },
      {
