    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental price range for a 3 BHK independent house in Sector 105 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Rental prices in Sector 105 vary significantly based on property size, age of construction, level of furnishing, and exact proximity to the Dwarka Expressway. Generally, a modern, well-maintained 3 BHK independent house or builder floor can range from INR 25,000 to INR 45,000 per month. Luxury villas or exceptionally spacious properties with private gardens will command higher rents, often exceeding INR 60,000. It is crucial to view the property's specific amenities and negotiable components to determine the final rental amount."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 105 generally furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "Sector 105 offers a balanced mix of furnishing options. The majority of new builder floors tend to be semi-furnished, including modular kitchens, modern wardrobes, and essential light fixtures. However, there is a good selection of fully-furnished independent houses catering to corporate leases or those seeking immediate occupancy. We recommend clarifying the exact inclusions before signing the lease to ensure all your needs are met."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration when I rent house in Sector 105",
        "answer": "The standard lease agreement for residential properties in Gurgaon, including Sector 105, is typically 11 months, which is then renewable upon mutual agreement. Some landlords are open to 12-month or longer agreements, especially for high-value properties or corporate tenants. Ensure the lease includes clauses addressing the lock-in period, notice period for termination, and terms for rent escalation upon renewal."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security deposit is required for rental properties in this sector",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Sector 105 is generally equivalent to two months' rent. However, depending on the demand for the specific property or if the house is fully furnished with expensive amenities, some landlords may request three months' rent as a deposit. This deposit is refundable upon vacating the premises, provided there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all dues are cleared."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 105 well-connected for daily commuting to Cyber City",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 105 boasts excellent connectivity, particularly due to its proximity to the Dwarka Expressway. This major corridor significantly streamlines travel towards Cyber City and other commercial areas like Udyog Vihar. While traffic conditions can vary, the improved road infrastructure offers a relatively quick commute compared to other peripheral sectors of Gurgaon."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is typically responsible for external maintenance of independent houses",
        "answer": "In most agreements for independent houses, the landlord is responsible for major structural repairs, external painting, and repairs related to building structure or core utility systems like main plumbing lines. The tenant is usually responsible for minor internal maintenance, replacing consumables (bulbs, fuses), and general upkeep. Detailed maintenance responsibilities should be clearly outlined in the rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses in Sector 105",
        "answer": "Pet policies are entirely at the discretion of the individual landlord when you rent an independent house. While independent houses are generally more pet-friendly than apartment complexes, many landlords still restrict pets, especially large breeds. If you have pets, it is crucial to explicitly inform us upfront so we can filter listings to only include pet-friendly independent houses for your consideration."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utility charges are tenants responsible for paying monthly",
        "answer": "Tenants are typically responsible for all consumed utility charges. This includes electricity based on individual meter readings, water usage (though sometimes included in a small monthly maintenance fee), and cooking gas. If the property uses a Genset for power backup, the fuel costs or related maintenance charges are also usually borne by the tenant."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I move into a property after finalizing the agreement",
        "answer": "The move-in timeline is generally quite fast once the agreement is signed, the security deposit is paid, and the first month's rent is transferred. This typically takes 3 to 7 working days, allowing time for stamp duty registration of the lease agreement and necessary utility transfers. If the property requires minor cleaning or repair, this may extend the timeline slightly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a broker to rent house in Sector 105 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "While you can search independently, utilizing a professional broker specializing in Sector 105 significantly streamlines the process. We offer verified listings, handle legal documentation, negotiate favorable terms, and provide localized support, ensuring you secure the best property efficiently and safely, minimizing the risks associated with private dealings."
