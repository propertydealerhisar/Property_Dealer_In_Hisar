    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the average rent for an independent house in Sector 14 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Rental costs vary significantly based on the size of the house, configuration such as 2 BHK versus 4 BHK, the plot size it is built on, and the age or modernity of the construction. Generally, smaller portions or houses on 4 to 6 Marla plots might start from INR 25,000 to INR 40,000 per month. Larger independent houses on 8 to 14 Marla plots can range from INR 65,000 to over INR 1,50,000 per month depending on the level of luxury, furnishing status, and amenities provided. We provide detailed market analysis to ensure you secure a fair deal when you Rent House in Sector 14."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 14 typically furnished or semi-furnished",
        "answer": "The majority of independent houses and residential floors available for rent in Sector 14 Gurgaon are offered either semi-furnished or unfurnished. Semi-furnished typically includes essential permanent fixtures such as modular kitchens, built-in wardrobes, fans, lights, and geysers. Fully furnished options are less common and are usually found in the premium or newly renovated segments, often commanding a higher monthly rental rate. Tenants must always clarify the exact list of inclusions with their property agent before finalizing the rental agreement and security deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration is common for rentals in Sector 14",
        "answer": "The standard residential lease agreement duration in Sector 14 and throughout most of Gurgaon is 11 months, which is then renewable upon mutual agreement. Some landlords may offer a 12-month lease with a lock-in period. For corporate or high-value leases, agreements might extend to 24 or 36 months, though this is less common for standard individual rentals. We recommend a minimum 11-month period to secure stable occupancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security deposit is required for a rental house in this sector",
        "answer": "Landlords in Sector 14 typically require a security deposit equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy period, subject to deductions for any damages beyond normal wear and tear or unpaid utility bills. For high-end luxury properties or fully furnished homes, the security deposit might sometimes be requested for three months' rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is parking managed for independent houses in Sector 14 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "One of the key advantages of renting an independent house in Sector 14 is the provision of dedicated parking space. Most houses, especially those on 6 Marla plots and above, include an internal driveway or garage for at least one vehicle. Smaller units might rely on street parking, which is generally well-managed in this established sector, unlike in highly dense apartment complexes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental homes in Sector 14",
        "answer": "Pet policies are strictly determined by the individual property owner. Since these are independent houses, the flexibility is often greater than in apartment societies. However, it is essential to disclose any pets upfront. Many landlords allow small pets but may request an additional non-refundable deposit or stipulate specific conditions regarding pet behavior and property maintenance. Always get pet approval in writing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 14 considered a safe neighborhood for families",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 14 is widely regarded as one of the safest and most reliable residential sectors in Central Gurgaon. It is a mature, high-density residential area with excellent local police patrolling and a strong community atmosphere. The independent house format also means fewer transient residents compared to large apartment complexes, contributing to a secure environment ideal for raising families."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utility costs are typically borne by the tenant",
        "answer": "In addition to the monthly rent, tenants are generally responsible for all utility costs specific to their unit. These usually include electricity consumption as per meter readings, water charges if applicable beyond a standard allowance, and any services like DTH cable or Wi-Fi internet connection. Some independent floors might share a common generator cost, which should be clarified in the agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast is the process to Rent House in Sector 14 through your agency",
        "answer": "Our streamlined process ensures efficiency. Once we understand your requirements, we can conduct property viewings within 24 to 48 hours. After selecting a property, the documentation and agreement signing typically take 3 to 5 working days, provided all necessary identity proofs and security deposits are readily available. We aim for a swift and hassle-free move-in experience."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet a portion of the house I rent in Sector 14",
        "answer": "Subletting is almost universally prohibited under standard residential lease agreements in Gurgaon unless explicitly permitted by the landlord in writing. Rental agreements are typically signed between the property owner and the named tenants only. If you require shared living arrangements, all residents should ideally be named on the primary lease agreement to maintain compliance and avoid potential legal disputes."
