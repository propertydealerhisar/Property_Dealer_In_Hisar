    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental price range for a 2 BHK apartment in Sector 48 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "The rental price for a standard 2 BHK apartment in Sector 48 typically ranges from INR 18,000 to INR 30,000 per month, depending heavily on the building type and amenities. Builder floors tend to be on the lower end, while flats within gated societies offering premium facilities like gyms, power backup, and security will fall towards the higher end of this bracket. Independent houses or larger furnished units will command significantly higher rents."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses or builder floors easily available for rent in Sector 48",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 48 is known for having a good mix of residential options, and independent houses and builder floors are quite accessible here, especially compared to sectors dominated purely by high-rise complexes. Builder floors in particular are very popular due to their privacy and often generous space. Availability usually fluctuates with the season, so using an agent with active listings is advisable to secure the best properties quickly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration is standard when I rent house in Sector 48",
        "answer": "The standard lease duration in Sector 48 and most of Gurgaon is 11 months, which is legally recognized as a short-term lease and simplifies renewal processes. However, landlords are increasingly open to signing 12-month or even multi-year leases for dependable tenants. Be prepared for a lock-in period, typically 6 months, where neither party can prematurely terminate the agreement without penalty."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common security deposit requirements in this area",
        "answer": "Most landlords in Sector 48 require a security deposit equivalent to two months' rent. For highly furnished or premium luxury properties, this deposit may extend to three months' rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy, subject to the property being returned in good condition, allowing for standard wear and tear."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 48 well-connected by public transport for daily commuting needs",
        "answer": "Absolutely Sector 48 boasts excellent connectivity. While it is slightly away from the immediate metro line, rapid feeder buses, autos, and shared taxis are readily available. The proximity to Sohna Road and the Golf Course Extension Road ensures quick access to key business hubs like Cyber City and Golf Course Road via established road networks, making daily commutes efficient."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental properties in Sector 48",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly between individual landlords and residential societies. Generally, independent houses and builder floors are more accommodating towards pets than high-rise societies, where restrictions or specific rules often apply. It is crucial to confirm the pet policy explicitly before finalizing any agreement to rent house in Sector 48 to avoid future disputes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What additional maintenance charges should I budget for in high-rise societies",
        "answer": "In gated high-rise societies, tenants are typically responsible for paying monthly maintenance charges which cover services like common area upkeep, security, power backup for common areas, and amenity usage. These charges can range from INR 3,000 to INR 6,000 per month, depending on the society and the size of your unit. Always clarify if these charges are included in the stated rent or are to be paid separately."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a rental property after finalizing the agreement",
        "answer": "Once the lease agreement is signed and the security deposit and first month's rent are paid, move-in can often happen within 2 to 7 days. This period allows for final cleaning, utility meter readings, and mandatory documentation like police verification and society registration, which must be completed before you take possession."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are furnished houses common or should I expect unfurnished rentals",
        "answer": "Both furnished and unfurnished rentals are available in Sector 48. Unfurnished properties are more common in builder floors and older independent houses.
