    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit required when I rent a house in Ashok Vihar",
        "answer": "The typical security deposit in Ashok Vihar generally ranges from two to three months' worth of rent. This amount is standard practice across most independent houses and builder floors. However, for highly luxurious or fully furnished properties, landlords may sometimes request a deposit equivalent to four months' rent. This deposit is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy, provided the property is returned in good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and tear. Always clarify the exact deposit structure and refund timeline in the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses or builder floors more common for rent in Ashok Vihar",
        "answer": "While traditional independent houses are abundant, especially in the older, well-established lanes of Phase I, modern builder floors have become increasingly prevalent, particularly in Phase II and III. Builder floors offer newer construction, often with better security features and modern amenities like dedicated parking and power backup. They appeal to renters seeking contemporary designs, while independent houses offer more expansive, private living spaces perfect for larger families."
      },
      {
        "question": "How reliable is the water and electricity supply in Ashok Vihar rental properties",
        "answer": "Ashok Vihar enjoys relatively stable utility services. Water supply is typically managed through municipal connections, supplemented by dedicated underground storage tanks and sometimes borewells in independent houses. Electricity supply is generally robust, although residents often opt for inverter backup systems or generator connections in builder floors to handle rare power interruptions. We ensure that the operational status of all utility connections is clearly documented before you move in."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for properties in Ashok Vihar",
        "answer": "The most common lease duration for residential rental properties in Ashok Vihar is 11 months, which is often renewable. However, many landlords are open to signing a 12-month agreement, and for corporate leases or highly desirable tenants, agreements extending to 24 or 36 months may be negotiated. It is essential to understand the lock-in period clause, which specifies the minimum duration you must stay before vacating without penalty."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accessible is the Delhi Metro from the various phases of Ashok Vihar",
        "answer": "Ashok Vihar boasts excellent connectivity to the Delhi Metro network. The proximity to stations on the Pink Line and Yellow Line is a major advantage. Specific phases offer different accessibility. For instance, parts of Phase I and II are quite close to the Shalimar Bagh and Keshav Puram stations, making commuting very convenient. Public transport like auto-rickshaws and buses provide easy last-mile connectivity to all metro stations from deeper residential areas."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and general maintenance in a rental house",
        "answer": "Typically, the responsibility for maintenance is divided. Minor running repairs like bulb replacements or plumbing snags are usually the tenant's responsibility. Major structural repairs, issues related to the building exterior, or breakdowns of fixed equipment provided by the landlord (like geysers or AC units) fall under the landlord's purview. These specific divisions of responsibility must be clearly detailed in the rental agreement to avoid disputes during the tenancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a house in Ashok Vihar if I have a pet",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among landlords in Ashok Vihar. While many private independent house owners may be open to pets, especially in ground-floor units, some builder floor societies or individual landlords maintain strict no-pet rules. It is crucial to inform your rental agent upfront about your pet requirements. We can filter listings specifically to find pet-friendly homes and negotiate the terms with the potential landlord, sometimes involving an additional refundable pet deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the best amenities to look for when renting a family home here",
        "answer": "For families, key amenities often include proximity to large, well-maintained DDA parks, which are numerous in Ashok Vihar. Look for properties offering dedicated, covered parking, 24/7 security services, and easy walking access to quality schools and local provision stores. Additionally, properties with reliable power backup and sufficient storage space are highly valued by families residing long term in the area."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it possible to find fully furnished houses for rent in Ashok Vihar",
        "answer": "Yes, while semi-furnished properties (featuring modular kitchens and wardrobes) are most common, there is a substantial market for fully furnished houses and builder floors, especially catering to expatriates or professionals on short-term assignments. Fully furnished homes include all essential furniture, appliances, and sometimes even kitchenware. These command a premium rental rate but offer significant convenience and immediate occupancy potential."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a real estate agent to rent house in Ashok Vihar or can I find one directly",
        "answer": "While direct deals are possible, hiring a professional real estate agent specializing in Ashok Vihar is highly recommended. An agent provides access to verified listings, handles legal documentation, negotiates favorable terms, and offers crucial local insight into fluctuating rental prices and building regulations. Their expertise saves you time and ensures you avoid potential pitfalls or legal complications common in private rental transactions."
