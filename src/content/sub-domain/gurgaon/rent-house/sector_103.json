        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for rental agreements in Sector 103, similar to most parts of Gurgaon, is usually 6 to 12 months. During this period, neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the lease without facing financial penalties, usually equivalent to 1 or 2 months rent. After the lock-in period, a mutual notice period, typically 1 to 2 months, is required to vacate the premises smoothly. Always confirm the specific terms regarding termination and lock-in duration with the landlord before signing the agreement."
      },

        "question": "Are security deposits high for independent houses and villas in Sector 103",

Luxury villas may sometimes command a slightly higher deposit. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all dues are cleared."
      },

Landlords require these documents for tenant verification. We assist in ensuring all necessary paperwork is correctly compiled and registered for legal validity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 103 safe for families and are independent houses secured",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 103 is widely considered a safe and well-planned residential area. Many independent houses and builder floors are situated within gated colonies that maintain strict security protocols, including guarded entry and exit points, and perimeter walling.

        "answer": "When renting a house in Sector 103, you should budget for monthly utility costs including electricity, water, and sometimes a dedicated maintenance fee for shared facilities in gated communities. Electricity is typically billed based on consumption rates set by DHBVN. Water supply is usually consistent but may be charged monthly. Tenants are responsible for their personal utility connections like high-speed internet and DTH cable services."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a house in Sector 103 if I have pets",
        "answer": "Pet policies are highly dependent on the individual landlord and the specific housing society rules.

      {
        "question": "Are property inspections standard before moving into a rental house",
        "answer": "Yes, a thorough property inspection is a standard and recommended practice.
