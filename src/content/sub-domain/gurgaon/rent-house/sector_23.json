    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the typical rental rates for a 3 BHK independent house in Sector 23",
        "answer": "Rental rates in Sector 23 can vary significantly based on the plot size, whether it is a builder floor or an independent Kothi, the age of construction, and the level of furnishing. For a standard semi-furnished 3 BHK builder floor, you can generally expect prices ranging from INR 25,000 to INR 40,000 per month. Luxury 3 BHK independent houses on larger plots or newly constructed floors might command rents between INR 45,000 and INR 65,000, especially if they include high-end finishes, private parking, and lift facilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 23 a safe area for families and working women to live",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 23 is widely considered one of the safer and more established residential sectors in old Gurgaon. It benefits from active Resident Welfare Associations RWAs which often manage security guards and CCTV surveillance in inner lanes. The sector has well-lit main roads and a significant presence of long-term residents, contributing to a stable and secure environment, making it an excellent choice for families and female professionals seeking safe independent housing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close is Sector 23 to the nearest Metro Station and key commercial areas",
        "answer": "Sector 23 is exceptionally well-connected. The IFFCO Chowk Metro Station and Guru Dronacharya Metro Station are accessible via a short drive, offering connectivity to the Gurgaon Yellow Line. Furthermore, it is ideally located close to the major business centers. Udyog Vihar is only about 10-15 minutes away, and Cyber City can usually be reached within 20 minutes depending on traffic conditions, making the commute highly manageable for corporate workers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard duration for a rental agreement in Sector 23",
        "answer": "The standard duration for residential rental agreements in Sector 23 Gurgaon is 11 months, which is renewable upon mutual agreement. Some landlords, particularly those offering higher-end or fully furnished properties to corporate clients, may prefer a 12-month or even 24-month lease. We strongly advise tenants to review the lock-in period clause, which is typically 6 months, and the notice period for vacating, usually 1 or 2 months, before finalizing the rent house agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in independent houses available for rent in Sector 23",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined solely by the individual landlord or the RWA, particularly in builder floors. While independent houses generally offer more flexibility than apartment complexes, pet approval is never guaranteed. It is crucial to inform us upfront if you have pets so we can specifically filter listings where the landlord is pet-friendly, as many properties maintain a strict no-pet policy due to potential property damage or neighbor concerns."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical security deposit requirements when renting a house here",
        "answer": "The standard practice for residential rentals in Sector 23 is to charge a security deposit equivalent to two months worth of rent. However, for fully furnished houses or high-demand properties, landlords might request three months rent as a security deposit. This amount is refundable at the end of the tenancy, subject to deductions for any damage beyond normal wear and tear, and often includes one month of advance rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent for independent houses",
        "answer": "For independent houses or builder floors, external maintenance like common area cleaning or lift operation if applicable might be included, but generally, utilities and major internal repairs are the tenant’s responsibility. Unlike apartments, there is usually no fixed monthly maintenance fee paid to an association. Tenants typically pay for electricity, water, and gas usage separately, and minor repairs are often handled by the tenant, as specified in the lease document."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I find a fully furnished house for rent in Sector 23 easily",
        "answer": "Yes, the market for fully furnished houses in Sector 23 is robust, catering largely to corporate leases and expats. These options usually command a higher rent but offer superior convenience. Furnishings typically include beds, wardrobes, air conditioners, kitchen appliances like refrigerators and microwaves, and sometimes washing machines. Our listings allow filtering specifically for fully furnished options to streamline your search."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for viewing and finalizing a rental property in Sector 23",
        "answer": "The process starts with identifying suitable options from our verified listings based on your budget and requirements. We then arrange site visits at your convenience. Once you choose a property, you submit an Expression of Interest EOI and earnest money. We facilitate the negotiation of terms, prepare the legally compliant agreement, and manage the documentation handover upon deposit payment and key exchange."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is Sector 23 often preferred over nearby Sector 22 or Palam Vihar",
        "answer": "Sector 23 is often preferred due to its central location offering slightly better infrastructure and direct, wider road access. While Sector 22 is also established, Sector 23 offers larger plot sizes and typically fewer congestion issues on main roads. Palam Vihar is extensive, but Sector 23 provides closer proximity to NH 48 and the central Gurgaon business spine, making it strategically advantageous for many renters."
