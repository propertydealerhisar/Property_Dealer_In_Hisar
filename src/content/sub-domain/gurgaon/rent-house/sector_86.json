    "title": "Common Questions About How to Rent House in Sector 86 Gurgaon",
    "description": "Get detailed answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding residential house rentals, lease terms, security deposits, and lifestyle in Sector 86 Gurgaon.",
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period when renting a house in Sector 86",
        "answer": "The standard residential rental agreement in Sector 86 typically mandates a minimum lock-in period of 6 months. During this time, the tenant cannot vacate the property without forfeiting the security deposit, and the landlord cannot ask the tenant to leave without facing a penalty outlined in the lease agreement. After the initial lock-in period, a standard notice period, usually 1 or 2 months, applies for either party to terminate the tenancy legally. Always review the specific lock-in clause in your final rental deed before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is required for rental properties in Sector 86",
        "answer": "The security deposit required for houses to rent in Sector 86 Gurgaon usually ranges from two to three months' worth of rent. This amount is held by the landlord as collateral against potential damages to the property or failure to pay rent or utilities. It is fully refundable at the end of the tenancy, provided the tenant hands over the property in good condition and clears all outstanding dues. Negotiating the deposit amount might be possible for long-term leases or high-value properties."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent or paid separately in Sector 86",
        "answer": "This varies significantly depending on the type of property and the terms set by the landlord or society. For apartments in large complexes, rent typically includes the common area maintenance charged by the builder or RWA for services like lift operation, security, and common facility upkeep. However, sometimes the tenant is required to pay a monthly maintenance fee separately to the society management. Ensure your lease clearly specifies who is responsible for these charges before finalizing your move."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation do I need to prepare to rent a property quickly in Gurgaon",
        "answer": "To expedite the rental process in Sector 86, tenants should prepare essential documents including Aadhar Card, PAN Card, passport-sized photographs, and proof of current employment or student status, such as an offer letter or recent salary slips. For non-Indian citizens, valid visa and passport copies are mandatory. Having these documents ready significantly speeds up background checks and lease agreement drafting."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 86 a safe residential area for families and children to live",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 86 is highly regarded as one of the safer and well-planned residential areas in New Gurgaon. Most properties are situated within modern gated societies that employ extensive CCTV surveillance, controlled access points, and professional security guards round the clock. The area's development is structured, minimizing unregulated growth and enhancing overall community security for families and children."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a house in Sector 86 if I own pets like dogs or cats",
        "answer": "The allowance of pets depends entirely on the specific society rules and the individual landlord’s preference. While some modern complexes in Sector 86 are pet-friendly, others strictly prohibit large animals or any pets in general. It is crucial to inform us about your pets upfront so we can filter listings to only show properties where pets are explicitly permitted, avoiding future complications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common lease durations offered for residential houses here",
        "answer": "The most common lease duration for residential houses to rent in Sector 86 is 11 months, renewable thereafter. This duration avoids stamp duty registration requirements necessary for leases of 12 months or more. However, many landlords are open to signing 12-month or 24-month registered agreements, especially for tenants who commit to long-term residency. Always clarify the desired lease term before negotiations begin."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical utility connection procedures for a rented house",
        "answer": "Once you move into a rental property in Sector 86, the electricity connection is usually already active but needs to be transferred or registered under the tenant's name for billing purposes. Water supply is typically included in the society maintenance. Tenants are responsible for setting up their own gas connection either via pipeline if available or through LPG cylinder suppliers, as well as internet and DTH services."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I ensure the rental house is well-maintained before moving in",
        "answer": "Before signing the lease and handing over the deposit, conduct a thorough joint inspection of the property with the landlord or our representative. Document the condition of all fittings, fixtures, appliances, and walls. Request that any necessary repairs, painting, or deep cleaning be completed before the date of possession. This prevents disputes regarding wear and tear when you eventually move out."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there good options for fully furnished houses to rent in Sector 86 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 86 offers a substantial inventory of fully furnished houses and apartments, catering especially to corporate tenants and those seeking minimal setup effort. Fully furnished units include essential furniture, kitchen appliances, and often even smaller household items. While the rent is generally higher than semi-furnished options, the convenience factor makes them very popular in this high-demand locality."
