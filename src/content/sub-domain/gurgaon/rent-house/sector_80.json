    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rent range for a house in Sector 80 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "The rental price for a house in Sector 80 varies widely depending on several factors including property type, size, age of construction, and specific location within the sector. A spacious 3 BHK builder floor might range from INR 25,000 to INR 40,000 per month. Luxurious independent villas or larger 4 BHK houses located in gated societies can command rents between INR 50,000 and INR 80,000 or even higher. It is essential to consider whether the property is furnished, semi-furnished, or unfurnished, as this greatly impacts the final rental amount you will pay."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there many independent houses available for rent in Sector 80 or mostly apartments",
        "answer": "Sector 80, being a rapidly developing area along the expressway, offers a good mix of housing options. While apartments in large society complexes are abundant in the wider area, Sector 80 specifically has a growing inventory of independent houses and builder floors, especially in the peripheral areas and smaller residential pockets. If your preference is for an independent unit with greater privacy and personal space, this sector is an excellent choice for finding a suitable rent house."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit requirement for rental properties in Sector 80",
        "answer": "In Gurgaon, including Sector 80, the standard practice for the security deposit is typically equivalent to two months' rent. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided the tenant has adhered to all contractual terms, paid all pending utilities, and the property is returned without significant damages beyond normal wear and tear. Some premium properties or individual landlords might request up to three months' rent as a deposit, but two months is the most common industry norm."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for a rent house in Sector 80 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "The overwhelming majority of residential leases in Sector 80 and the rest of Gurgaon are structured for a minimum duration of 11 months, which can be renewable. Some landlords prefer a longer commitment, such as 12, 18, or 24 months, particularly for larger or high-value independent houses. Discussing your preferred tenure early in the negotiation phase is crucial, as longer leases often provide stability for both the tenant and the property owner."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the water and power supply infrastructure in Sector 80 for rental homes",
        "answer": "Sector 80 benefits from being a planned sector in New Gurgaon. Most modern housing options, especially gated communities and recently constructed builder floors, have reliable infrastructure. Power supply is generally stable, often backed up by society-level generators or individual inverter provisions. Water supply is typically managed through municipal connections and borewells; however, it is always recommended to confirm the specific water source and storage capacity of the particular rent house before finalizing the agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses and builder floors in Sector 80",
        "answer": "Pet policies are strictly determined by the individual landlord or the RWA of the specific community where the house is located. In independent houses or builder floors, landlords are generally more flexible and accommodating regarding pets compared to high-rise apartments. When searching for a rent house in Sector 80, clearly communicate your requirement for a pet-friendly property upfront so we can filter listings accordingly, saving you considerable time and effort."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents do I need to prepare before renting a house in Sector 80",
        "answer": "To streamline the renting process, you should prepare certain key documents. These typically include a government-issued photo ID proof like an Aadhar Card or Passport, current address proof, copies of your PAN card, and employment verification documents such as a company ID or the latest salary slips. Foreign nationals will require a valid visa and passport. These documents are necessary for background checks and registration of the lease deed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance responsibilities fall upon the tenant versus the landlord in Sector 80 rental homes",
        "answer": "Generally, the landlord is responsible for structural repairs, major electrical wiring issues, plumbing breakdowns, and wear and tear replacement of major appliances provided with the house. Tenants are typically responsible for day-to-day minor maintenance, cleaning, replacement of light bulbs, and ensuring basic upkeep of the property. This division should always be clearly detailed and specified in the final rent agreement to avoid any potential disputes during the tenancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 80 Gurgaon considered a safe area for families and children",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 80 is widely regarded as a safe and family-friendly locality. Many of the available rental houses are situated within secure, gated communities which employ strict security protocols including 24/7 guards, CCTV surveillance, and controlled access points. The overall planned nature of the area and its proximity to developing infrastructure contributes to a secure and peaceful environment for residential living."
