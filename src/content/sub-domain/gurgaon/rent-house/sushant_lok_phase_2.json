      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit amount required when I rent house in Sushant Lok Phase 2",
        "answer": "The standard practice in Sushant Lok Phase 2, similar to most premium sectors in Gurgaon, typically requires a security deposit equivalent to two to three months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable upon the satisfactory completion of the lease term, minus any charges for damages beyond normal wear and tear. We always advise tenants to meticulously document the property condition before moving in to ensure transparency during the refund process."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration is common for houses for rent in this area",
        "answer": "The vast majority of residential leases in Sushant Lok Phase 2 are structured for a minimum duration of 11 months, which is renewable. However, many landlords prefer a 12-month or a 24-month lease agreement, often including a standard lock-in period of six months where neither party can prematurely terminate the agreement without penalty. Negotiating a two-year lease sometimes allows for a smaller annual rent escalation percentage."
      },

        "question": "Are maintenance costs included in the monthly rent for independent houses",
        "answer": "Generally, for independent houses and builder floors for rent in Sushant Lok Phase 2, the monthly rent covers the primary property usage but typically excludes routine maintenance charges. Tenants are usually responsible for utilities such as electricity, water, and gas, as well as minor repairs. Major structural or external repairs typically fall under the landlord’s responsibility. Always clarify the exact division of maintenance responsibilities in the lease agreement before signing."

        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among property owners in Sushant Lok Phase 2. While the locality itself is residential and features several parks, whether a specific house for rent is pet-friendly is entirely at the landlord's discretion. If you have pets, it is crucial to communicate this requirement upfront. We maintain a list of properties where landlords have expressed willingness to accept pets, sometimes requiring a higher security deposit to cover potential damages."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I expect to move in after finalizing the decision to rent a house",
        "answer": "If the house is vacant and documentation is finalized, the move-in process can often be completed within seven to ten days. This period allows time for police verification, completion of the legal agreement stamping, and transfer of utility connections if necessary. Our team works diligently to expedite the paperwork to ensure a quick and smooth handover process for our clients."

      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price listed for a property in Sushant Lok Phase 2",
