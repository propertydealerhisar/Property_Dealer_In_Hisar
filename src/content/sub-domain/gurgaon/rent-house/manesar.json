        "answer": "The standard security deposit required in Manesar often ranges between two to three months' worth of rent depending on the property type location and whether the unit is furnished or unfurnished.

Some landlords especially in high-rise societies may prefer a 12-month or even 24-month lease particularly for corporate tenants.
