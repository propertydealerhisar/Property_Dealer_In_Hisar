    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a rental agreement in Sector 77",
        "answer": "Rental agreements in Sector 77 Gurgaon usually follow a standard structure of an 11-month lease which is renewable. Most landlords enforce a mandatory lock-in period of 6 months. During this lock-in period, the tenant cannot vacate the property without incurring a penalty, usually the forfeiture of the security deposit or one month's rent. Always confirm the specific lock-in clause before signing your agreement to rent house in Sector 77."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is generally required for rentals here",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit across high-rise apartments and builder floors in Sector 77 is equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there is no damage to the property beyond standard wear and tear and all dues are cleared. For very high-end or fully furnished properties, the deposit may occasionally extend to three months rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the monthly rent in Sector 77 complexes",
        "answer": "Typically, the monthly rent quoted by the landlord does not include the society maintenance charges. These charges cover common area upkeep, security, power backup for common facilities, and garbage collection. The maintenance fee is usually paid separately by the tenant directly to the RWA or facility management team. Always clarify who is responsible for paying these charges before finalizing the deal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 77 a safe area for families and single female tenants",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 77 is considered a very safe and secure residential location. The vast majority of rental properties are located within modern, gated societies equipped with high-tech security features, boom barriers, and round-the-clock security personnel. The area has a robust civic infrastructure and remains well-lit and populated, enhancing overall safety, especially within the confines of residential towers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical duration for finding a good rental house in Sector 77 Gurgaon",
        "answer": "The time required to secure a rental house in Sector 77 varies depending on your requirements and the time of year. Generally, with professional assistance, the process from initial search to signing the lease takes about 7 to 14 days. The market moves quickly, especially for popular 2 BHK and 3 BHK units, so being prepared with documentation is crucial for a fast closure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in residential apartments in Sector 77",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly across different housing societies and even between individual landlords in Sector 77. While many complexes are pet-friendly, some RWA rules restrict certain sizes or breeds, and some landlords impose strict no-pet clauses. It is essential to communicate your need for a pet-friendly rental property clearly at the start of your search to avoid complications later."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for minor repairs and wear and tear during the tenancy",
        "answer": "Standard practice dictates that the tenant is responsible for minor repairs such as light bulb replacements, minor plumbing fixes, and general upkeep that falls under 'day-to-day maintenance'. Major structural repairs, issues with external painting, or system failures like geysers or air conditioners that are part of the original fit-out are typically the landlord's responsibility. Lease agreements clearly detail this division."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common utility charges a tenant must pay separately",
        "answer": "As a tenant in Sector 77, you will typically be responsible for monthly consumption charges for electricity, water if not included in maintenance, piped natural gas PNG if applicable, and internet/DTH services. Tenants usually need to transfer the electricity meter account into their name or pay based on meter readings provided by the landlord or society."

      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the monthly rent price in Sector 77",
        "answer": "Yes, rental prices are negotiable, although the margin for negotiation often depends on current market demand, the length of the lease you are offering, and whether the property is fully furnished or unfurnished. We leverage our market expertise to secure the best possible monthly rent on your behalf, especially if you commit to a longer tenure than the standard 11 months."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is needed to finalize a rental agreement here",
        "answer": "To finalize the lease and rent house in Sector 77, you will typically need copies of Aadhar Card, PAN Card, proof of employment or business registration, recent salary slips or bank statements, and passport-sized photographs. Foreign nationals require a valid visa, passport, and proof of local employment or study. Our team assists in compiling and verifying all necessary documents."
