        "answer": "The standard commercial lease duration in new developments within Sector 106 Gurugram typically ranges from three to nine years. Most landlords prefer a minimum lock-in period of 36 months to ensure stability. Specific terms depend on the size of the shop and the profile of the tenant, with larger national brands often negotiating longer lease agreements up to nine years, sometimes including escalation clauses every three years."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of security deposit is required for commercial rentals in this area",
        "answer": "Generally, commercial property owners in Sector 106 require a security deposit equivalent to three to six months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable upon the successful termination of the lease, provided all terms and conditions, including property damage and utility payments, have been met. It is advisable to clarify the deposit terms and refund timeline upfront in the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there specific restrictions on the type of business operating in Sector 106 shops",
        "answer": "While Sector 106 is broadly zoned for commercial and retail use, certain complexes or buildings may have specific restrictions related to usage, such as prohibiting heavy manufacturing, highly polluting industries, or businesses that create excessive noise. It is crucial to verify the allowed usage for your specific shop unit before finalizing the rental agreement to ensure compliance with local regulations and complex by-laws."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the fit-out period generally provided for new retail tenants",
        "answer": "The rent-free fit-out period allows tenants to customize the shop space before starting operations. For a standard shop for rent in Sector 106, this period usually ranges from one to three months, depending on the scale of renovation required. If significant construction or specialized interior work is needed, negotiation for an extended fit-out period is often possible and should be clearly documented in the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common maintenance charges and who is responsible for utilities",
        "answer": "Maintenance charges typically cover common area expenses like security, common lighting, elevator upkeep, and cleaning. These charges are usually paid monthly by the tenant, calculated on a per-square-foot basis. Tenants are generally responsible for all individual utility consumption, including electricity, water, and internet services within their specific shop unit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking easily available for customers in the commercial areas of Sector 106 Gurugram",

        "question": "Can I sublet my rented commercial space in Sector 106",
        "answer": "The ability to sublet is entirely dependent on the terms outlined in your primary lease agreement with the property owner.

It is strongly recommended to clarify subleasing rights before signing the contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are high-visibility ground floor shops more expensive to rent than upper floors",
        "answer": "Yes, ground floor shops, especially those with high street-facing visibility and direct access, command a significant premium over shops located on upper floors or in basements. This premium reflects the drastically increased foot traffic and immediate customer exposure that ground floor units guarantee, which is crucial for retail success in Sector 106."
