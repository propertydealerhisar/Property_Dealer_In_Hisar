      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 80 suitable for setting up a food and beverage outlet",
        "answer": "Sector 80 is exceptionally suitable for F&B operations due to its dense residential catchment area and lack of high-quality dining options currently available.

      {
        "question": "Can I customize the interior layout of a rented shop space",

      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are necessary for signing a commercial shop rental agreement in Gurugram",
