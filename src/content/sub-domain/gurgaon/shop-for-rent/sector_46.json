    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a commercial shop lease in Sector 46 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The standard mandatory lock-in period for commercial rentals in this highly competitive area typically ranges from 18 to 36 months, depending heavily on the size of the shop and the significant investment required for internal fit-outs by the incoming tenant. Landlords impose these specific lock-in periods to ensure stability for their investment and effectively recoup the vacancy costs associated with potential early lease termination. Negotiating a shorter lock-in period might be conditionally possible for smaller retail service spaces, but generally, longer commitments result in significantly more favorable overall lease terms and advantageous rental agreements over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are maintenance and common area charges handled for shops in Sector 46",
        "answer": "Maintenance and essential common area charges usually cover necessary services such as backup electricity supply for common areas, professional security services, efficient garbage disposal, and comprehensive upkeep of the building exteriors and shared facilities. These charges are universally payable monthly, always separate from the base rent amount. The final amount varies significantly based on whether the shop is located in a standalone market building or a premium managed commercial complex. Always meticulously clarify the exact scope of services comprehensively covered under the maintenance fee before signing any official rental agreement document."
      },
      {
        "question": "What essential documents are required to secure a shop rental agreement in Sector 46",
        "answer": "To successfully secure a commercial shop rental in Sector 46, you will typically need valid identity proof for all business principals (Aadhaar Card, PAN Card), permanent address proof, the mandatory business registration certificate (GST or proprietorship documents), and recent bank statements or verifiable financial stability proofs. A standard and legally binding 11-month or multi-year registered lease agreement will be executed requiring stamp duty payment based strictly on the total aggregated value of the lease contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is commercial space in Sector 46 suitable for high-end restaurant operations",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 46 offers several strategic commercial properties highly suitable for high-end restaurant operations, especially units located near the main thoroughfares or specifically within dedicated commercial food court zones. When considering a restaurant space, it is critically important to verify the existing infrastructure readiness, particularly adequate water supply capacity, high load electricity connections, and designated exhaust duct provision, as these essential requirements significantly impact initial fit-out costs and ongoing regulatory compliance requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the expected security deposit requirement for renting a shop here",
        "answer": "In the Sector 46 commercial market, the standard security deposit requirement for shops generally ranges from 3 to 6 months of the agreed upon monthly rent, depending on the landlord and lease duration. This substantial deposit is securely held by the landlord throughout the entire tenancy period and is fully refundable upon the tenant vacating the premises, subject only to deductions for any significant damages beyond standard normal wear and tear or outstanding utility bills. Always negotiate this specific amount based on your desired rental duration and the business entity's credit standing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does proximity to the Metro station affect shop rental prices in Sector 46",
        "answer": "Proximity to the crucial Sector 46 Metro Station significantly increases both visibility and sustained foot traffic, which translates directly to a noticeable premium on commercial shop rental prices. Shops located within a close 500-meter radius of the operational station often command 15 to 25% higher rents compared to properties further afield due to the guaranteed assurance of commuter flow and ease of accessibility for a much broader customer base coming from outside Sector 46."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there restrictions on the type of business I can operate in a rented shop in Sector 46",
        "answer": "Zoning regulations stipulated by the Gurugram local municipal body strictly govern the permissible use of all commercial properties. Most shops in dedicated commercial areas of Sector 46 are suitable for standard retail, general professional offices, or service industry operations. However, heavy industrial manufacturing, storage of hazardous materials, or certain high-impact industrial activities are typically strictly prohibited. Always officially confirm the specific property’s official usage classification with the local municipal authority or expert property manager before commencing any form of commercial business activity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical annual rental escalation rate in Sector 46 leases",
        "answer": "Commercial shop rental agreements in Sector 46 almost always include a clause detailing mandatory annual rental escalation. This escalation rate typically falls between 5% and 10% per annum, calculated on the previous year’s rent, to account for inflation and market growth. This is a standard industry practice designed to align rental income with prevailing market dynamics, so budget for this scheduled increase yearly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for interior modifications and fit-outs when renting a shop",
        "answer": "Typically, the incoming tenant is fully and solely responsible for all non-structural interior modifications, including the installation of flooring, false ceilings, lighting fixtures, and specialized fit-outs required for their specific business operations. Any major structural changes are strictly prohibited and require mandatory prior written approval from the landlord and must fully comply with all necessary local building codes. Ensure that the lease agreement clearly defines the exact condition in which the shop must be professionally returned upon the eventual lease expiry date."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet a portion of my shop space in Sector 46 to another business",
        "answer": "Subletting commercial space is generally restricted and often explicitly prohibited in standard lease agreements in Sector 46 unless specifically agreed upon in advance and documented in writing with the property owner. If you plan to sublet any part of the space, you must secure the landlord’s explicit written consent first. Unauthorized subletting constitutes a material breach of contract and can lead to immediate lease termination and forfeiture of the security deposit."
