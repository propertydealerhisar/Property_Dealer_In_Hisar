Retail spaces often favor 3+3+3 year agreements while larger anchor stores may secure longer initial terms like 5 years with fixed escalation clauses.

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average security deposit required for renting commercial space here",
        "answer": "The security deposit usually equates to 3 to 6 months worth of the quoted rent depending on the landlord and the perceived risk of the tenant’s business operations. High-profile retail brands may negotiate a lower deposit while new startups often need to provide a deposit closer to the 6-month threshold. This deposit is fully refundable upon the successful termination of the lease provided the property is returned in good condition."
