    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for a shop for rent in Sector 65 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The standard commercial lease agreement in Sector 65 generally spans 36 months or three years. However, this is often preceded by an initial lock-in period, usually between 12 to 18 months, during which neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the agreement without penalty. Longer lease terms, such as 5 to 9 years, are often negotiated for larger showroom spaces or anchor tenants to ensure stability for significant investment in interior fit-outs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the quoted rental price for commercial shops",
        "answer": "Typically, maintenance charges are separate from the base rent and are payable directly to the society management or RWA of the commercial complex. These charges cover essential services such as common area lighting, elevator upkeep, security services, garbage disposal, and water supply for common bathrooms. Prospective tenants must clarify the exact components covered by the maintenance fee and the monthly cost before signing the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of security deposit is required when renting a shop in Sector 65",
        "answer": "For commercial properties in Sector 65, the required security deposit is usually equivalent to 3 to 6 months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable upon the successful completion of the lease term, provided the tenant returns the premises in the condition stipulated in the agreement, accounting for normal wear and tear. The exact deposit amount depends heavily on the size and location of the shop."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I make structural changes to the shop once the lease agreement is signed",
        "answer": "Most commercial shop leases strictly prohibit structural changes or modifications to the exterior facade of the building. Interior modifications, such as setting up non-permanent partitions, installing specialized lighting, or making cosmetic improvements, are generally permitted but require explicit written consent from the landlord before execution. Any approved changes are typically expected to be reversed when vacating the property."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the annual rent escalation handled in Sector 65 commercial rentals",
        "answer": "The annual rental escalation clause is a standard feature of commercial leases in Sector 65. The typical yearly increase ranges between 5% and 8% of the previous year's rent. This percentage is clearly defined in the lease agreement. Tenants should ensure they fully understand how the escalation is calculated and when it takes effect to budget accurately for subsequent years."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there specific shop spaces available for food and beverage businesses in Sector 65",
        "answer": "Yes, many new commercial projects in Sector 65 have dedicated zones for Food and Beverage units. These units are often equipped with necessary infrastructure like increased power load capacity, provisions for exhaust ducts, and accessible common waste management areas. It is crucial to specify your F&B requirement when searching for a shop for rent to ensure compliance with local health and safety regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the price of a shop for rent in Sector 65",
        "answer": "Rental prices are primarily influenced by four key factors the specific location within the sector (main road frontage demands a premium), the floor level (ground floor is the most expensive), the size and condition of the property, and the amenities provided by the complex like dedicated parking or central air conditioning. Shops closer to residential entry points or established brand outlets fetch higher rents."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 65 a good location for high-end retail brands",
        "answer": "Absolutely Sector 65 is rapidly emerging as a destination for high-end retail due to the concentration of affluent residents in the neighboring areas and excellent connectivity. Securing a premium shop for rent here offers the visibility and demographic profile necessary to support luxury goods and high-value services, guaranteeing a sophisticated consumer market."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a commercial broker to secure a shop for rent in this area",
        "answer": "While it is possible to search independently, engaging a professional commercial broker specializing in Sector 65 listings is highly recommended. Brokers provide access to unlisted properties, assist in negotiating favorable lease terms, ensure all legal documentation is accurate, and help streamline the licensing process saving significant time and potential legal complications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What governmental licenses are required to open a shop in Sector 65 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Depending on the business type, you will typically need a Trade License from the local municipal corporation, registration under the Shops and Establishments Act, GST registration, and potentially a Fire Safety Certificate. F&B businesses require additional licenses like the FSSAI license. We guide our clients through the necessary paperwork to ensure full compliance before operations commence."
