    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the typical lease durations for a shop for rent in Sector 3 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Commercial lease durations in Sector 3 usually range from 3 to 5 years although shorter 1 or 2-year options may be available for smaller units or startup businesses. We generally recommend a minimum 3-year lock-in period with a mutual notice clause to provide stability for both the tenant and the landlord. Longer leases provide better security for businesses investing heavily in interior fit-outs and branding ensuring a prolonged period of operational stability without the immediate threat of rent revision or relocation. All lease agreements clearly define renewal terms and escalation rates typically set at 5-10% every 12 months."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much is the average security deposit required for commercial space in this sector",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit for commercial shops for rent in Sector 3 is generally equivalent to 3 to 6 months of the gross monthly rent depending on the size of the unit and the quality of the fit-out. Premium properties or those with high-value infrastructure may require a slightly higher deposit which is often negotiable. This deposit is fully refundable upon the satisfactory termination of the lease agreement provided all rent utilities and property conditions are met as per the contractual obligations specified in the signed document."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of businesses are most successful when renting a shop in Sector 3",
        "answer": "Sector 3 is highly receptive to essential service businesses due to the large surrounding residential population.

The key to success is aligning your business offering with the strong local demand for convenience and accessibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are parking facilities readily available for commercial renters in Sector 3",
        "answer": "Parking availability varies significantly depending on the specific location of the shop. Units located on main commercial roads typically rely on shared street parking or dedicated commercial parking lots managed by the local association. Shops within specific shopping complexes usually provide dedicated basement or surface parking for customers and tenants. We always specify the exact parking provisions for each listing ensuring clarity on customer and staff accessibility before you commit to renting the commercial space."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility connections like electricity and water included in the monthly rent",
        "answer": "Generally no utility charges like electricity water and maintenance fees are separate from the base monthly rent and are entirely the responsibility of the commercial tenant. Commercial units often require specific commercial electricity meters and connections which the tenant must apply for or transfer into their name upon possession. However the lease agreement will clearly specify if any common area maintenance CAM charges are applicable to cover shared services like security lighting or lift operations within a commercial complex structure."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for viewing and finalizing a shop rental agreement in Sector 3",

        "answer": "Yes most landlords permit interior customizations or non-structural fit-outs provided these changes are non-structural and are reversible upon the termination of the lease unless otherwise agreed in writing. Major structural changes like wall removal or significant plumbing alterations always require explicit written consent from the landlord and local municipal authority approvals beforehand. It is essential to clearly define the permitted modifications and who bears the cost of restoring the property in the lease agreement before commencing any work."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the rental price of commercial shops in Sector 3",
