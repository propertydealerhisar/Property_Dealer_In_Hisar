    "description": "Get clear, concise answers to the most common questions prospective commercial tenants have when exploring rental opportunities in Sector 99.",
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the rental price of a Shop For Rent in Sector 99",
        "answer": "The rental price is primarily determined by the unit's exact location within the sector (e.g., main road vs internal complex), the floor level (ground floor units are typically higher), the shop's size, and the quality of the building infrastructure. High-visibility corner shops and properties in new commercial complexes usually command a premium due to superior footfall and modern amenities. We provide detailed breakdowns showing how these factors influence your final lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for commercial properties in Sector 99",
        "answer": "The standard lease duration for a Shop For Rent in Sector 99 is usually 3 years, with options for renewal built into the contract. Longer leases, such as 5 years, are sometimes preferred by corporate tenants requiring stability. Most agreements include a fixed escalation clause (often 10 to 15 percent) every three years to account for market changes. Short-term leases are rare but negotiable for specialized pop-up retail."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent for commercial spaces here",
        "answer": "Generally, maintenance charges (CAM Common Area Maintenance) are separate from the base rent and cover security, cleaning of common areas, elevator operation, and generator backup power for shared services. Tenants usually pay this fee monthly or quarterly. It is crucial to clarify which services are covered by the CAM and if utility bills like electricity and water are metered and charged separately."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of security deposit is required when renting a shop in Sector 99 Gurugram",
        "answer": "For commercial rentals in Sector 99, the standard security deposit ranges from three to six months' worth of the total rent, depending on the landlord and the perceived risk of the tenant's business type. This deposit is refundable upon the satisfactory handover of the premises at the end of the lease term, subject to any necessary repairs beyond fair wear and tear."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate or modify the commercial shop after renting it",
        "answer": "Any significant structural modifications require the express written consent of the landlord and often mandate approval from local municipal authorities. Minor, cosmetic changes like painting or shelving are generally allowed, but the property must usually be returned to its original state unless otherwise negotiated and documented in the lease agreement. Always secure approvals before starting any fit-out work."
      },
      {
        "question": "What amenities should I look for when leasing a shop space",
        "answer": "Essential amenities for a Shop For Rent in Sector 99 include sufficient parking space for customers, 24/7 security surveillance and personnel, reliable power backup provisions, dedicated freight elevators (if applicable for multi-story buildings), and proper fire safety systems. Proximity to public transport and good connectivity are also critical operational advantages."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 99 suitable for food and beverage businesses and what regulations apply",
        "answer": "Sector 99 offers strong demand for F&B businesses due to surrounding residential catchment areas. However, F&B operations require specific infrastructure like provision for kitchen exhaust ducts, dedicated water lines, and proper grease traps. Tenants must also secure mandatory licenses including the FSSAI license, fire safety clearance, and trade license from the relevant Gurugram authorities."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the entire leasing process usually take from inquiry to moving in",
        "answer": "The entire process typically takes between four to six weeks. This timeline covers initial viewing and selection, negotiation of terms, drafting and signing of the lease agreement, legal registration, and the time allotted for the tenant to complete their necessary fit-out or renovation work before opening their business doors. Efficient documentation speeds up the process significantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific restrictions on business types allowed in Sector 99 commercial areas",
        "answer": "While most retail and service-based businesses are welcome, certain activities that generate excessive noise, pollution, or require heavy industrial equipment might be restricted by local zoning laws or the complex's management regulations. It is essential to confirm that your proposed business activity aligns with the authorized use of the specific commercial building before signing the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I check the availability of prime corner Shops For Rent in Sector 99",
