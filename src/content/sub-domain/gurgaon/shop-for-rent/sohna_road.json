      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a retail shop for rent on Sohna Road",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for commercial rentals in prominent Sohna Road complexes generally ranges between 12 to 36 months. This period mandates that neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the lease agreement. While 18 to 24 months is common for smaller retail units, larger anchor spaces might require a longer commitment to secure favorable base rents and capital expenditure recovery for fit-outs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the security deposit calculated for commercial property in Sohna Road",
        "answer": "Security deposit requirements for a shop for rent in Sohna Road typically range from three to six months of the agreed-upon gross rent. This deposit serves as collateral against potential damages to the property or failure to pay rent. The exact amount is negotiable and often depends on the prestige of the commercial complex and the duration of the lease term being finalized."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the quoted rental price for shops",
        "answer": "Generally, maintenance charges called Common Area Maintenance or CAM are separate from the base rent. These charges cover shared facilities such as security, common lighting, lift operations, cleaning services, and upkeep of public areas within the complex. Tenants are usually required to pay the CAM fee monthly or quarterly in addition to the monthly rent payment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a commercial lease agreement on Sohna Road",

For limited companies, the Memorandum of Association and Board Resolution authorizing the signatory are also mandatory requirements for lease execution."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the average rental rates for a shop for rent in Sohna Road Gurgaon",

High-street properties or ground floor units in premium malls can command rates upwards of INR 150 to INR 300 per square foot per month. Rates for higher floors or back-office retail hybrid units are generally lower and more economical for certain business models."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I modify the interior of the rental shop to suit my business needs",
        "answer": "Most commercial leases allow tenants to undertake interior fit-outs and modifications. However, these changes must strictly adhere to the complex’s design guidelines and require prior written approval from the landlord and building management. Structural changes are usually prohibited and the tenant is typically responsible for returning the shop to its original condition upon lease expiry."

      },
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the increase in rent upon lease renewal for a shop",
        "answer": "Rent escalation upon renewal is typically pre-defined in the lease agreement, usually ranging from 10% to 15% after a three-year term. External factors influencing higher escalations include the prevailing market rates, increased demand for commercial space in the specific micro-market, and major infrastructure improvements in the Sohna Road area."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I take possession of a ready-to-move shop for rent",
        "answer": "If a shop is ready-to-move with existing infrastructure, possession can often be transferred quickly, sometimes within 7 to 15 days following the signing of the lease agreement and payment of the security deposit and first month's rent. Complex fit-out requirements will naturally extend the time needed before actual business operations can commence."
