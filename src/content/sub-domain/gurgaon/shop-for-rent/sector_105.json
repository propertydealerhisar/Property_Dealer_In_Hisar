    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a commercial shop lease in Sector 105",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for commercial rentals in new developments like Sector 105 generally ranges from 12 to 36 months, depending on the size of the shop and the landlord’s specific investment strategy. A lock-in period legally binds both the tenant and the landlord from terminating the lease prematurely, providing stability for the tenant to establish their business. For large anchor tenants or customized fit-outs, longer lock-in periods of up to 5 years might be negotiated. We ensure that the lock-in clause is clearly defined in your agreement before you commit to renting the shop."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent for commercial properties here",
        "answer": "Generally, maintenance charges for common area facilities are separate from the monthly rent for commercial shops in Sector 105 complexes. These charges typically cover lift operation, common area lighting, 24/7 security services, waste management, and upkeep of exterior facades. The exact amount is calculated based on the square footage of the rented shop. Tenants are advised to clarify the maintenance structure with the landlord and the complex management before signing the lease to avoid any confusion later."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize the agreement for a rental shop",
        "answer": "To finalize a commercial lease agreement in Sector 105, tenants typically need to provide KYC documents such as Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and proof of address. If the lease is in the name of a business entity, you will need the Company registration certificate, GST registration details, and board resolution authorizing the signatory. A security deposit, usually equivalent to 3 to 6 months' rent, and the first month's advance rent are also required at the time of signing the registered lease deed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 105 suitable for food and beverage businesses requiring heavy exhaust systems",
        "answer": "Yes, many commercial complexes in Sector 105 are designed with dedicated F&B zones that include the necessary provisions for heavy exhaust systems and grease traps, crucial for restaurants and large kitchens. However, it is vital to select a shop that is specifically earmarked for F&B usage to ensure compliance with municipal fire safety and health codes. Our team can help you identify shops for rent that meet all the technical specifications required for high-volume cooking and service operations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate the interior of a rented shop in Sector 105",
        "answer": "Interior renovations, known as fit-outs, are usually permitted but require prior written consent from the landlord and adherence to the commercial complex's structural guidelines. Minor cosmetic changes might be allowed easily, but major structural alterations, changes to facade design, or modifications impacting the HVAC system usually require detailed drawings and approvals. The lease agreement will specify whether the property must be restored to its original condition upon lease termination."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rent escalation clause in Sector 105 commercial leases",
        "answer": "Standard commercial lease agreements in Sector 105 usually include a rent escalation clause stipulating an increase every 12 months. The typical rate of escalation ranges between 5% and 10% per annum, depending on market conditions and the landlord’s policy. Long-term leases often have clearer, fixed escalation rates to provide budget predictability for the tenant throughout the lease tenure."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important is the location within the commercial complex for a retail shop",
        "answer": "Location within the complex is critically important, particularly for retail success. Shops located on the ground floor facing the main road, near the entrance or adjacent to an anchor store, will naturally attract higher footfall. While internal courtyard locations can offer quieter environments suitable for services, prime retail requires high visibility points to maximize spontaneous purchases and brand recognition."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there parking facilities available for customers and staff at these shops for rent",
        "answer": "Yes, modern commercial complexes in Sector 105 are required to provide adequate parking facilities. Most sites offer dedicated basement parking for customers and potentially open parking spaces. Tenants should verify the availability of reserved parking for their own staff as part of their rental negotiation. Adequate parking is a significant factor in attracting high-spending customers to your rented shop."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for registering the commercial lease deed",
        "answer": "The commercial lease deed must be registered with the local Sub-Registrar's office in Gurugram to make it legally binding and admissible in court. Both the landlord and the tenant are typically required to share the cost of stamp duty and registration fees. Our legal team assists clients by preparing the necessary documentation and guiding them through the mandatory registration process after the lease terms have been mutually agreed upon."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sublet the shop for rent in Sector 105",
        "answer": "Subletting a commercial shop in Sector 105 is generally not permitted unless explicitly authorized in writing by the primary landlord. Most commercial leases contain strict clauses prohibiting or severely restricting the tenant's ability to sublease the space to another party. If you anticipate needing to sublet, this must be discussed and agreed upon during the initial negotiation phase, as unauthorized subletting can lead to immediate termination of the primary lease agreement."
