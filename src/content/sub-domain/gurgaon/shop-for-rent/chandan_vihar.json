    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions About Renting a Shop in Chandan Vihar Gurugram",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a shop for rent in Chandan Vihar",
        "answer": "The standard commercial lease agreement in Chandan Vihar Gurugram usually includes a lock-in period of 12 to 36 months, depending on the property type and the landlord's preference. A lock-in period means neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the lease prematurely during that timeframe, ensuring stability for both parties. Always clarify the implications of breaking the lock-in clause, which often involves penalty payments equivalent to several months' rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is required for commercial shops in Chandan Vihar",
        "answer": "Commercial property security deposits in Chandan Vihar typically range from 3 to 6 months of the monthly rent. This deposit serves as collateral against damages or default on rent payments. It is fully refundable upon the successful termination of the lease, provided the property is returned in good condition as per the agreement terms. Ensure the lease clearly outlines the deposit refund timeline and conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent for shops in Chandan Vihar",
        "answer": "In most Chandan Vihar commercial properties, maintenance charges are separate from the base rent. These charges cover common area services like electricity backup, security, cleaning of shared spaces, and lift operations if applicable. Always ask for a detailed breakdown of the maintenance costs and what services they cover before finalising the rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the rental price of a shop in Chandan Vihar Gurugram",
        "answer": "Several critical factors dictate the rental price. These include the shop's exact location, the floor level (ground floor units are premium), the frontage and visibility on the main road, total usable square footage, and the age of the building. Shops near high-density residential clusters or major intersections command higher rents in Chandan Vihar."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate or modify the rented shop space in Chandan Vihar",
        "answer": "Modifications or renovations typically require explicit written consent from the landlord. Minor cosmetic changes like painting might be acceptable, but structural changes usually are not permitted or require the tenant to restore the shop to its original condition upon lease expiry. Review the 'fit-out' and 'make good' clauses in your lease agreement carefully before planning any major internal layout changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to secure a commercial shop lease in Chandan Vihar",
        "answer": "To secure a commercial lease, tenants typically need to provide KYC documents like Aadhaar card and PAN card, business registration documents (GST certificate, business license), and financial stability proof such as bank statements or tax returns for established businesses. Legal vetting of these documents is a standard part of our service."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking space guaranteed with a rented shop in Chandan Vihar",
        "answer": "Parking availability varies significantly based on the specific property type and location within Chandan Vihar. Shops in dedicated commercial complexes often have designated parking, while properties on main market streets may only offer street parking. Always confirm the availability and type of parking (reserved or common) before signing the lease if parking is a critical requirement for your business."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the process take to finalise a shop rental agreement",
        "answer": "Once a suitable shop is identified and the terms are agreed upon, the documentation and legal finalisation usually take between 7 to 14 working days. This timeframe allows for thorough background checks, drafting of the final lease deed, payment of the security deposit, and mutual signing by both the tenant and the landlord."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utility connections should I verify before renting a shop",
        "answer": "Before committing to a lease in Chandan Vihar, verify essential utility connections including sufficient electrical load capacity for your machinery or AC units, water supply, and provision for high-speed internet connectivity. Ensure the existing meters are functioning and the billing process is clearly defined in the lease to avoid future disputes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of businesses thrive in Chandan Vihar Gurugram",
        "answer": "Chandan Vihar's strong residential base makes it ideal for retail services, grocery stores, pharmacies, coaching centers, small clinics, and restaurants or cafes.
