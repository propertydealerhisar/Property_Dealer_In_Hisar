        "question": "How are maintenance and utility costs handled in a rented shop in Sector 25",

Always clarify the CAM breakdown before signing the lease."

      },
      {
        "question": "What factors determine the rental price of a shop in Sector 25",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do rental agreements in Sector 25 include annual rent escalation clauses",
        "answer": "Almost all commercial shop rental agreements in Sector 25 Gurugram include an annual escalation clause.
