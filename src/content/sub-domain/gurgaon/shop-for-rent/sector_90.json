    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a commercial shop rental agreement in Sector 90",
        "answer": "The standard commercial lease agreement in Sector 90, consistent with most of Gurugram, usually stipulates a minimum lock-in period of 36 months or three years. This period ensures stability for both the tenant and the landlord, reflecting the significant investment required for commercial fit-outs and branding. Longer lock-in periods sometimes come with more favorable initial rental escalation clauses, which is an area our team specializes in negotiating for your benefit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the average rental rates for commercial shops in Sector 90 based on location",
        "answer": "Rental rates vary substantially based on three key factors size, floor level, and proximity to the main road or anchor tenants. Shops with direct main road frontage or located on the ground floor near residential exit gates command premium rates, often starting higher per square foot. Upper floor shops or units in interior markets are generally more affordable, making them suitable for service businesses. Contact us directly for a personalized, up-to-date rental rate chart specific to your business requirement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there additional charges besides the monthly rent for commercial tenants",
        "answer": "Yes, commercial tenants are typically responsible for several additional charges beyond the base monthly rent. These commonly include common area maintenance charges, electricity and water usage, property taxes (if passed through by the landlord, which is common), and insurance for the interior fittings and inventory. It is crucial to clarify the exact structure of CAM (Common Area Maintenance) fees before signing the lease, and we ensure this transparency."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a shop for rent in Sector 90 Gurugram",
        "answer": "To finalize a commercial rental agreement, tenants must typically provide proof of business registration (GST registration or Udyam Aadhaar), KYC documents (Aadhaar, PAN) of the authorized signatories, bank statements for financial verification, and the security deposit cheque. For established companies, a resolution from the board authorizing the lease agreement is also mandatory. We guide you step-by-step through the required documentation checklist."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 90 a good location for Food and Beverage establishments like cafes and restaurants",
        "answer": "Sector 90 is an exceptional location for F&B establishments due to the dense surrounding residential population and limited existing high-quality dining options. Shops located within commercial complexes that offer proper ventilation and grease trap provisions are highly sought after. Demand for quick service restaurants, family dining, and small cafes is high, promising steady consumer traffic, especially during evening hours and weekends."
      },
      {
        "question": "How soon can I move in after signing the lease agreement for a rental shop",
        "answer": "The move-in timeline depends on the current status of the shop. If the shop is a bare shell unit, you will typically receive possession immediately after the registration of the lease deed and payment of the security deposit, allowing you to begin your fit-out work. If the shop is already fitted, the transition is usually quicker, often within 15-30 days, once all utilities are transferred to the tenant's name. We facilitate rapid possession where possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I modify the interior of the rental shop to suit my business needs",
        "answer": "Yes, commercial tenants are generally permitted to undertake interior modifications and fit-outs, but only after receiving explicit written consent from the landlord and ensuring that the structural integrity of the building is not compromised. Major changes often require municipal approval. It is standard practice to stipulate that the shop must be returned to its original bare shell condition at the end of the lease term unless otherwise agreed upon."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard procedure for rent escalation during the lease period",
        "answer": "Commercial rental agreements in Sector 90 typically include a pre-defined annual or biennial rent escalation clause. The most common increase is between 5% and 8% per annum, calculated on the preceding year's base rent. This rate is fixed for the duration of the initial lease term, providing budgetary predictability for your business. We ensure that this clause is fair, reasonable, and clearly outlined in the final agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much is the typical security deposit required for a shop rental in this sector",
        "answer": "For commercial properties in Sector 90, the standard security deposit is usually equivalent to three to six months of the base rent. This deposit is held by the landlord throughout the lease period and is refundable upon the satisfactory termination of the lease, provided all terms and conditions are met, and there are no outstanding dues or damages to the property."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are power backup and dedicated parking facilities available with Sector 90 commercial rentals",
        "answer": "Most premium commercial complexes and high-street markets in Sector 90 offer robust common area power backup facilities and dedicated, secured parking spaces for both owners and customers. However, the availability of these specific amenities can vary from property to property. Our listings explicitly detail the infrastructure facilities available for each shop to ensure they meet your operational requirements."
