    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period when I secure a shop for rent in Sector 6",
        "answer": "The standard commercial lock-in period in established markets like Sector 6 Gurugram usually ranges between 18 to 36 months. This period mandates that neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the lease agreement without incurring substantial penalties. Always clarify this term before finalizing the lease, as it protects the landlord’s investment and ensures the tenant has stability to establish their business operations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is required for commercial rentals in this area",
        "answer": "Security deposits for commercial shops in prime areas of Sector 6 generally equal three to six months worth of the quoted rent. This amount is refundable upon the successful completion of the lease term, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear. Ensure the lease clearly outlines the terms for deposit return and any applicable deductions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are property taxes included when I rent a commercial shop in Sector 6",
        "answer": "Generally, property taxes are the responsibility of the landlord or the property owner. However, commercial leases often specify that certain operational costs, such as maintenance fees, common area electricity, or specialized utility charges, are passed onto the tenant. Always verify the precise division of all utility and governmental charges within your rental agreement to avoid unexpected expenses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate or modify the interior of a rented shop in Sector 6",
        "answer": "Minor cosmetic changes like painting or adding removable fixtures are usually permitted. However, any structural modifications, significant electrical work, or changes affecting the building's exterior typically require explicit written consent from the landlord before commencement. It is essential to document all agreed-upon modifications in the lease addendum to prevent disputes upon lease expiry."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes Sector 6 a better commercial choice than adjacent sectors like Sector 7 or 8",
        "answer": "Sector 6 benefits from a superior blend of connectivity and high residential density coupled with established local commercial zones. While neighboring sectors offer space, Sector 6 often provides higher foot traffic density and a more centralized location for services, giving businesses a distinct advantage in immediate consumer outreach and established market reputation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the monthly rent escalation typically handled in a Sector 6 commercial lease",
        "answer": "Standard commercial rental agreements in Gurugram usually include an annual rent escalation clause. This increase typically ranges between 5% and 10% per annum depending on the property type and current market conditions. Ensure the escalation percentage and calculation method are fixed and clearly defined in the initial lease document."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there parking facilities available for customers visiting shops in Sector 6",
        "answer": "Most established commercial areas and market complexes in Sector 6 provide dedicated customer parking, either in front of the shops or within common parking lots. However, street parking availability varies based on the specific location. Confirm the parking situation as accessibility greatly impacts customer convenience and overall business volume."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a specific license to open a business in a Sector 6 rented shop",
        "answer": "Yes, all commercial establishments in Gurugram require necessary municipal permissions and trade licenses from the local governing body. While the landlord provides the property, obtaining the appropriate operational license specific to your business type (retail, food service, educational) is strictly the responsibility of the tenant."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I finalize a lease agreement and move into a shop for rent",
        "answer": "Once a suitable shop for rent in Sector 6 is identified and terms are agreed upon, the process typically takes 10 to 15 working days. This timeframe allows for necessary due diligence, security deposit transfer, stamping of the lease deed, and final handover of the keys. Having documentation ready accelerates this timeline significantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the typical dimensions for a good retail frontage in Sector 6",
        "answer": "For optimal retail display and visibility, a minimum frontage of 12 to 15 feet is generally recommended for small to mid-sized shops in Sector 6. Larger showrooms should aim for 20 feet or more. A good frontage ensures passersby notice your business, significantly increasing the potential for impulse purchases and brand recall."
