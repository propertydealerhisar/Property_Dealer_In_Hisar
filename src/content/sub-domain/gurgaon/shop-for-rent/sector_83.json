        "answer": "The standard commercial lock-in period in Sector 83 generally ranges between 18 to 36 months depending on the complex size and negotiation strength. For high-street shops the lock-in might be shorter around 12 months. It is crucial to understand that during the lock-in period the tenant cannot vacate the premises without incurring significant financial penalties usually equivalent to the remaining rent for that duration. We ensure the lease agreement clearly defines these terms mitigating future risk for your business."
