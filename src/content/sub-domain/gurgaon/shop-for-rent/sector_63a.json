        "question": "How soon can I start my fit-out work after signing the lease agreement",
        "answer": "Generally, fit-out work can begin immediately after the lease deed is registered and the initial payments are successfully processed. However, tenants must first submit detailed architectural plans of their proposed interior modifications to the landlord or the commercial complex management for approval. This ensures that structural integrity is maintained and complex-specific building codes, especially regarding fire safety, are strictly adhered to during the construction phase."
