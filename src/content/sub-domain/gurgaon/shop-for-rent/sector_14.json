        "answer": "The foot traffic on the main arterial roads of Sector 14 is exceptionally high, making it a premium location for retail businesses.

Retail shops located on these main roads experience consistent daily pedestrian and vehicular movement, leading to excellent brand visibility and higher conversion rates compared to shops located inside smaller commercial complexes or side streets."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is sufficient parking available for customers in commercial areas of Sector 14 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Parking availability varies depending on the specific property.
