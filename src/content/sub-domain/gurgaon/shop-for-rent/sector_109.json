    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What types of businesses are most suitable for a shop rental in Sector 109",
        "answer": "Sector 109 is excellent for a wide variety of businesses due to its mixed-use development and large residential catchment. The area is highly suitable for quick-service restaurants, specialty grocery stores, fashion boutiques, health and wellness clinics, pharmacies, and banks or ATM outlets. Given the new construction, demand for home decor, furniture showrooms, and professional services like chartered accountants and legal firms is also very high. Ground floor units near main roads are best for high-footfall retail, while upper floors are suitable for service-based businesses or back offices."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for commercial properties in Sector 109",
        "answer": "The standard lease duration for commercial shops in Sector 109 typically ranges from three to nine years. A common structure is a 3+3+3 year agreement, where tenants have the option to renew every three years. Landlords usually prefer a minimum commitment of 3 years to ensure stability. Lock-in periods often apply for the first 12 to 18 months. Shorter leases are rare and usually apply only to kiosks or temporary pop-up shops. The rent escalation clause, typically 5% to 10% increase every one to three years, is standard and negotiated upfront."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific charges besides the monthly rent for a shop in this sector",
        "answer": "Yes, aside from the base monthly rent, tenants should budget for several additional charges. These commonly include a refundable security deposit, usually equivalent to 3 to 6 months of rent. Tenants are also responsible for common area maintenance charges (CAM), which cover services like security, lift operation, common area lighting, and cleaning, often charged per square foot. Utility bills (electricity, water) are separate and based on consumption. Furthermore, legal fees for the lease agreement registration and stamp duty must also be factored into the initial setup cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important is location within Sector 109 when choosing a shop for rent",
        "answer": "Location within Sector 109 is critically important and directly impacts rent and business success. Shops located on the ground floor facing the main road or prominent junctions command the highest rents and offer the best visibility, ideal for retail brands. Inner market locations are suitable for lower-overhead service providers. Consider proximity to parking areas, the anchor tenants in the complex, and the specific residential gates they serve. A prime corner location guarantees two-sided visibility, which is a major advantage for branding."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a commercial shop rental agreement in Gurugram",
        "answer": "To finalize a commercial shop rental agreement in Sector 109 Gurugram, both parties must provide comprehensive documentation. The tenant (business entity) typically requires proof of business registration, GST certification, company PAN card, and the authorized signatory's Aadhar and PAN card. The landlord provides property documents, ownership proof, and required no-objection certificates. A detailed Lease Deed must be signed, notarized, and often registered with the local Sub-Registrar’s office, along with proof of security deposit payment and first month's rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking easily available for customers and employees in Sector 109 commercial areas",
        "answer": "Yes, most modern commercial complexes and marketplaces offering shops for rent in Sector 109 are developed with adequate parking provisions. These typically include dedicated basement parking for tenants and specific surface or multi-level parking for customers. Ease of parking is a key selling point for these properties, ensuring a convenient experience for patrons. However, always confirm the specific parking allocation included with your shop unit and whether customer parking is free or paid within the complex."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate or modify the interior of the rental shop space",
        "answer": "Interior modifications are generally permitted, but they must be approved in writing by the landlord or the property management company before execution. Non-structural changes like internal partitioning, false ceilings, flooring upgrades, and painting are usually acceptable. Structural modifications, such as changing load-bearing walls or altering the exterior facade, are strictly prohibited. The lease agreement will clearly specify the scope of permitted alterations and whether the tenant is required to restore the property to its original condition upon vacation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How competitive is the rental market for new shops in Sector 109 right now",
        "answer": "The rental market in Sector 109 is currently competitive and high in demand, particularly for ground-floor shops and units within completed or nearly completed complexes. The area's rapid residential growth fuels this demand. While good opportunities exist, prompt action is advisable when a suitable property is identified. We recommend pre-qualifying your requirements and being prepared to move quickly to secure premium spaces, as they do not remain vacant for long in this burgeoning commercial hub of Gurugram."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required for commercial rentals here",
        "answer": "For commercial shops for rent in Sector 109, the industry standard security deposit is usually equivalent to three to six months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable upon the successful and timely termination of the lease, provided there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all outstanding dues have been cleared. Higher deposits might be requested for businesses involving high-risk inventory or specialized fit-outs, but three months is the most common starting point."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the rent include maintenance or utility charges in Sector 109",
        "answer": "No, the quoted rent for shops in Sector 109 typically excludes maintenance and utility charges. The rental figure usually only covers the cost of using the bare commercial space.
