    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for a shop for rent in Sector 95 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Commercial leases in Sector 95 typically range from 3 to 9 years, structured usually as 3+3+3 arrangements. Landlords generally prefer longer lock-in periods, often 18 to 36 months, particularly for large retail or restaurant spaces requiring significant tenant investment in fit-outs. We help negotiate mutually acceptable lease tenures that provide stability for your business while maintaining flexibility for future expansion plans in the Sector 95 market."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are security deposits calculated for commercial properties in Sector 95",
        "answer": "Security deposits for shops in Sector 95 are usually calculated based on the monthly rent. The standard industry practice is to request a deposit equivalent to 3 to 6 months of the prevailing rent, depending on the property type, the size of the shop, and the financial standing of the tenant. These funds are held by the landlord and are refundable upon the successful termination of the lease, minus any damages or outstanding dues."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent or paid separately for Sector 95 shops",
        "answer": "In most commercial complexes in Sector 95, maintenance charges are paid separately from the basic rent. These charges cover common area services like electricity, security, elevator upkeep, waste management, and common area cleaning. The rate per square foot varies depending on the amenities provided by the complex management, and we ensure you have a transparent understanding of these charges before signing the lease."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to secure a shop rental agreement in Sector 95",
        "answer": "To finalize a shop rental agreement, key documents typically include identity proof and address proof of the proprietors or directors (Aadhar, PAN), business registration documents (GST certificate, MOA/AOA for companies), and bank statements to verify financial stability. For corporate tenants, a Board Resolution authorizing the lease signing is also required. Our team assists in compiling and verifying all necessary documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate or modify the commercial shop after renting it in Sector 95",
        "answer": "Most commercial lease agreements permit internal non-structural modifications provided the tenant obtains prior written consent from the landlord. Structural changes are usually strictly prohibited. Tenants are often required to restore the shop to its original condition upon vacating, unless otherwise specified. We clarify the permitted fit-out scope during the negotiation phase for every shop for rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical annual rental escalation rate in Sector 95 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The standard annual rent escalation for commercial properties in major Gurugram sectors like Sector 95 is usually between 5% and 8%. This rate is pre-agreed upon and specified clearly within the lease deed. Higher rates might apply in prime, high-demand commercial projects, or if the initial rent was significantly below market value. We negotiate the most favorable escalation terms for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important is the location within Sector 95 for retail success",
        "answer": "Location within Sector 95 is paramount for retail success. High visibility, ground-floor accessibility, proximity to residential towers, and adequate parking are critical factors. A shop located facing the main road or near an anchor store will inherently draw more organic foot traffic than one located deep inside a complex, directly impacting sales and brand visibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there available shops for rent with immediate possession in Sector 95",
        "answer": "Yes, we maintain an updated inventory of ready-to-move-in and immediate possession shops for rent in various commercial projects throughout Sector 95. These units are often 'shell and core' requiring fit-outs, or sometimes semi-furnished. Contact our rental specialists today to receive a personalized list of properties available for immediate occupancy to minimize your operational downtime."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the rental value of shops vary by floor in commercial buildings in Sector 95",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Ground floor shops command the highest rental values due to superior visibility, direct street access, and maximum footfall exposure. Rental prices typically decrease significantly for shops located on upper floors, mezzanine levels, and basement areas, reflecting the drop in consumer visibility and accessibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utility connections should I check before renting a shop in Sector 95",
        "answer": "Before finalizing a shop for rent, ensure the property has adequate provision for essential utilities including high-capacity electricity load suitable for your commercial equipment, reliable water supply, and necessary sewage disposal connections. For restaurants, dedicated gas line availability and proper ventilation setup are critical checks that we facilitate during site inspection."
