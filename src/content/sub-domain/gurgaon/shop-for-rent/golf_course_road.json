      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for interior fit-outs and modifications to the shop space",
        "answer": "Generally, the tenant is fully responsible for all interior fit-outs, aesthetic modifications, and specialized infrastructure required for their business, such as HVAC systems or specialized lighting.

      {
