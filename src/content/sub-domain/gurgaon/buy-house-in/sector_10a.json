    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical price range for a residential house in Sector 10A Gurugram",
        "answer": "The price range is highly dependent on the plot size, construction age, and whether it is an independent house or a builder floor. Generally, well-constructed independent floors (on smaller plots) start from approximately 1.25 Crore onwards, while larger kothis on 8 Marla plots or more can easily range from 3 Crore to 7 Crore or higher. We advise consulting our current listing data for the most accurate, up-to-date pricing based on property specifications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 10A considered a safe area for families and children",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 10A is widely recognized as one of the safer, more traditional residential sectors in Gurugram. It benefits from an established community structure, active RWA involvement, and high occupancy rates which contribute to neighborhood vigilance. Its internal roads are well-lit, and the police presence is consistent due to its proximity to the Civil Lines area. It is highly recommended for family living."
      },
      {
        "question": "What type of property ownership is common in Sector 10A independent floors or cooperative societies",
        "answer": "Sector 10A is predominantly characterized by freehold plots where owners have built independent houses or modern builder floors (separate ownership of each floor). Cooperative housing societies are not the typical structure here. Most transactions involve clear registry of plot ownership or sale deeds for specific, legally demarcated floors, offering clear titles and ownership rights."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are properties in Sector 10A eligible for home loans from major banks",
        "answer": "Yes, properties in Sector 10A are generally highly favored by major financial institutions and banks for home loans. Because the sector is fully developed, planned by HUDA, and possesses clear title deeds, the risk profile is low. We work closely with leading banks to ensure smooth loan processing and can connect you with lenders who offer competitive rates for buying house in Sector 10A."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the connectivity of Sector 10A to the rest of Gurugram and Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Connectivity is excellent. Sector 10A offers immediate access to the Old Gurgaon Road which links directly to the Gurgaon-Gurugram Expressway (NH-48).

Public transport options, including local buses and shared auto-rickshaws, are readily available right outside the sector."
      },
      {
        "question": "What civic amenities like water and electricity supply are available",
        "answer": "Sector 10A enjoys reliable civic services managed by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and DHVBN. Water supply is typically consistent, drawing from both municipal lines and supplementary borewell systems in certain properties. Power supply is robust, though residents should check if the specific property requires a higher load connection for features like central air conditioning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is buying an older house in Sector 10A a good investment for future reconstruction",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Buying an older house specifically for reconstruction is a popular strategy here. The value often lies primarily in the land (the plot) due to the sector’s prime location. With favorable Floor Area Ratio (FAR) norms, many investors purchase older properties, tear them down, and rebuild modern independent floors to maximize rental income and capital appreciation, effectively capitalizing on the strong demand to buy house in Sector 10A."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common plot sizes measured in square yards or square meters",
        "answer": "While property listings often use the local term Marla (where 1 Marla is roughly 25 square yards), you will commonly find houses built on plots ranging from 100 square yards (4 Marla) up to 300 square yards (12 Marla). We ensure all our listings provide both the Marla measure and the corresponding square yards or square meters for international clients."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation should I verify before I buy house in Sector 10A",
        "answer": "Essential documents include the original sale deed (registry), mutation records (Intkal), occupancy certificate (if newly constructed), no-objection certificates from relevant authorities, and clarity on the FSI used. We conduct thorough due diligence, ensuring the property has no existing liens, is free from litigation, and has all property tax payments up to date, providing you with a clean transaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a house purchased in Sector 10A",
        "answer": "Since most available properties are ready-to-move-in houses or builder floors, occupancy is usually quick. Once the property is registered in your name (typically 1 to 4 weeks depending on loan approval and documentation), you can generally move in immediately. Unlike new projects, there are no construction delays to worry about when you buy house in Sector 10A."
