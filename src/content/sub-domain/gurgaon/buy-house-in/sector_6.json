The inventory mostly comprises independent houses, meaning properties built on individual plots, and modern builder floors.

      {
        "question": "Should I consider buying a house or a plot in Sector 6 for future construction",
        "answer": "Both options are viable, though the inventory for open plots is generally tighter than ready houses. Buying a plot gives you complete creative freedom to build your dream home to exact specifications.
