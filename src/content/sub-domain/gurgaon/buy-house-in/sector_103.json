        "answer": "The legal verification process involves thorough due diligence including checking the original title deed, verifying the Deed of Conveyance, and ensuring all property tax and utility bills are cleared.

        "answer": "Both Sector 103 and 102 are high-potential areas along the Dwarka Expressway. Sector 103 often benefits from slightly better immediate connectivity to parts of Pataudi Road and some established Gurugram residential areas. While both offer strong appreciation, Sector 103 presents a balanced mix of residential plots and high-rise developments, sometimes offering slightly better entry-level pricing for independent house construction, making it highly competitive."

        "question": "Is it safer to buy a builder floor or an independent house in Sector 103 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Both options offer high safety standards, especially within planned colonies. Builder floors often benefit from shared maintenance costs and centralised security services provided by the building management. An independent house offers greater privacy and customization but requires the homeowner to manage security and maintenance independently. The choice depends entirely on your preferred lifestyle and budgetary flexibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical timeline for possession if I buy a newly constructed house in Sector 103",
        "answer": "If you are purchasing a ready-to-move independent house or builder floor, possession is usually immediate upon completion of documentation and full payment, typically within 30 to 60 days. For houses currently under construction, the timeline depends entirely on the stage of completion and developer promises, though RERA registered projects usually maintain strict deadlines, generally ranging from six months to two years depending on project scale."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Sector 103 suffer from waterlogging or electricity supply issues during the monsoon season",
        "answer": "Due to modern infrastructure planning and well-developed storm water drainage systems, Sector 103 is significantly less prone to waterlogging issues compared to older parts of Gurugram.
