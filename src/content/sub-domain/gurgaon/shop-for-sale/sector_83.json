      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 83 a good location for high rental yield commercial investments",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 83 is considered an excellent location for high rental yield investments primarily because of its strategic position in New Gurugram and the massive influx of residents into surrounding housing societies.

Properties close to the NH 48 and major residential project entrances tend to generate the highest returns."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does connectivity impact the value of a shop for sale in Sector 83",
        "answer": "Connectivity is a monumental factor driving commercial property values in Sector 83. Direct accessibility via NH 48 ensures regional traffic exposure, while links to the Dwarka Expressway enhance connectivity to Delhi and Indira Gandhi International Airport. Superior connectivity guarantees high visibility for businesses and ensures a larger customer catchment area, which in turn leads to higher demand from quality tenants and superior capital appreciation over the medium to long term."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical size range for commercial shops available in this area",
        "answer": "The sizes of shops available for sale in Sector 83 vary significantly depending on the project type—whether it is a high-street market or an integrated commercial complex. Generally, shop sizes start from approximately 250 square feet carpet area for small service shops and can go up to 1500 square feet or more for larger anchor spaces, particularly those with double height specifications or corner positioning. It is crucial to verify the super area versus the carpet area before making a purchasing decision."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any specific legal considerations when buying commercial property in Sector 83",
        "answer": "When purchasing a commercial shop, key legal considerations include verifying the developer's RERA registration status, ensuring clear title deeds, and understanding the specific use limitations defined by the building plan. Commercial properties often have higher property tax rates and different maintenance charges compared to residential units, which must be factored into your financial planning. We recommend engaging a specialized real estate lawyer to scrutinize all documentation thoroughly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the advantages of investing in a ready to move shop versus an under construction project",
        "answer": "Ready to move shops offer the immediate benefit of starting operations or receiving rental income instantly, eliminating construction risk and prolonged waiting periods. However, they usually carry a higher price point. Under construction shops typically offer lower entry prices and better capital appreciation potential upon completion, though they involve waiting time and inherent construction risk. The choice depends on the investor’s risk appetite and requirement for immediate income generation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can Non Resident Indians NRI purchase a shop for sale in Sector 83 Gurugram",

      },
      {
        "question": "What future infrastructure developments will boost the value of shops in Sector 83",
