    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical expected rental yield for commercial shops in Sector 62",
        "answer": "The rental yield for a commercial shop in Sector 62 Gurugram typically ranges between 5 percent and 8 percent depending on the specific location of the unit and the quality of the tenant. Ground floor high-street shops usually command the highest per-square-foot rates due to their visibility and accessibility. Pre-leased properties, where a tenant is already secured, tend to provide returns at the higher end of this scale immediately, offering a predictable income stream from day one. Factors like parking availability, developer reputation, and proximity to major roads also influence the final achievable rent significantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it better to buy a pre-leased shop or a bare shell shop in Sector 62",
        "answer": "The choice between a pre-leased and a bare shell shop depends entirely on your investment goal. A pre-leased shop offers immediate, stable income and eliminates the risk and hassle of finding a tenant and setting up the space, making it ideal for passive investors prioritizing consistent cash flow. A bare shell shop, however, offers greater flexibility in terms of tenant selection and fit-out design, potentially allowing for higher future appreciation if you secure a premium brand tenant willing to pay top dollar after customization. Bare shell requires more active management initially but offers higher long-term control."
      },
      {
        "question": "What due diligence is essential before finalizing a commercial shop purchase here",
        "answer": "Thorough due diligence must include verifying the developer's RERA registration status and checking the occupancy and completion certificates for the project. You must also scrutinize the title deed to ensure clear ownership and check for any existing encumbrances or legal disputes against the property or the project itself. For under-construction projects, review the approved floor plans and ensure the specific shop unit measurements match the sales agreement.
