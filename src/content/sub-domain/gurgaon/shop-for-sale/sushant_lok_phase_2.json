        "question": "What is the typical price range for a shop for sale in Sushant Lok Phase 2",
        "answer": "The pricing for commercial shops in Sushant Lok Phase 2 varies significantly based on factors such as size, floor level, location within the sector (main road vs internal market), and whether it is a ready-to-move or shell property. Ground floor retail units on high-footfall roads command premium prices often starting from a few crores, while first-floor units or smaller kiosks are more budget-friendly. We recommend contacting us directly with your specific requirements so we can provide the latest market data and inventory matching your budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are commercial shops in Sushant Lok Phase 2 RERA registered",
        "answer": "If the shop for sale is part of a newly constructed or ongoing commercial project falling under the jurisdiction of the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HRERA), it must be RERA registered.

Our advisory team meticulously verifies the RERA status and all legal documentation for every property we list, providing you with full transparency on the property's compliance status."

        "question": "Can I get a commercial loan to buy a shop in Sushant Lok Phase 2 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Yes, major national and private banks offer commercial property loans for buying shops, provided the property has clear titles and approved building plans. The loan eligibility and percentage of funding usually depend on your credit history, income profile, and the value assessment of the specific shop. We can connect you with preferred banking partners who specialize in commercial real estate financing in the Gurugram area."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the expected rental yields for commercial property here",
        "answer": "Rental yields in prime Sushant Lok Phase 2 locations are generally higher than residential yields due to constant demand and limited supply. While specific figures fluctuate, investors typically anticipate yields ranging from 5% to 8% annually for well-located ground floor retail spaces, making a shop for sale in Sushant Lok Phase 2 a robust asset for income generation."
      },

      {
        "question": "Is it better to buy a ready-to-move shop or an under-construction commercial space",
        "answer": "The choice depends on your investment goal. Ready-to-move shops offer immediate possession, immediate rental income, and certainty of physical space, making them ideal for current cash flow. Under-construction spaces usually offer a lower entry price and higher appreciation potential upon completion, but involve waiting periods and development risk. In a high-demand sector like Sushant Lok Phase 2, ready-to-move properties are often preferred."

Buyers should always confirm the exact monthly maintenance fee structure with the current owner or the management association prior to finalizing the purchase agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does connectivity impact the value of a shop in this location",
        "answer": "Connectivity is paramount for commercial success. Shops directly accessible from major roads like Golf Course Extension or those near high-density residential towers fetch significantly higher prices and rental income. Excellent road networks ensure easy client access, delivery logistics, and higher visibility, directly boosting the commercial viability of the shop for sale in Sushant Lok Phase 2."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need permission to change the usage type of the commercial shop",
        "answer": "Commercial properties are zoned for specific uses (e.g., retail, office space, or restaurant). While minor changes within the commercial category are sometimes permissible, altering the primary usage (e.g., converting a retail shop into a warehouse) usually requires explicit approval from the local municipal corporation (GMDA) and adherence to zoning bylaws. Always consult with a legal expert before planning significant modifications or changes to the approved usage."
