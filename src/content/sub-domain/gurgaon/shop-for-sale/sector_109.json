        "question": "What are the primary advantages of buying a commercial shop in Sector 109 compared to established Gurugram markets",

        "question": "Is Sector 109 considered a high-footfall area for retail operations currently",

        "question": "What are the typical expected rental yields for a shop for sale in Sector 109 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Typical rental yields in Sector 109 for quality commercial space currently range robustly between 6% to 8% depending on the property type, location within the complex, and whether the shop is already pre-leased to a recognized brand. Properties with anchor tenants or located on high-street ground floors often command the upper end of this range offering a significantly better return profile than traditional residential investments in the same region of Gurugram."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there pre-leased shop options available in Sector 109 and what are their benefits",
        "answer": "Yes pre-leased options are highly desirable and readily available especially in newly delivered, quality commercial projects. The key benefit of buying a pre-leased shop is immediate rental income and near-zero risk of vacancy upon handover. It allows investors to completely skip the time-consuming waiting period for tenant acquisition and immediately start earning returns based on a guaranteed, long-term rental agreement typically backed by reputed national or international brands."

      {
        "question": "What legal documentation is required when purchasing commercial property in Sector 109",
        "answer": "You will require standard documentation including the comprehensive Builder Buyer Agreement, the RERA registration details of the project, the Occupation Certificate OC upon possession, and the full chain of title documents detailing ownership history.
