        "answer": "Sector 65 is known for providing competitive rental yields, usually ranging between 6 percent and 8 percent per annum, depending on the type of asset and the tenant profile.

      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common maintenance charges for a commercial shop in Sector 65",
        "answer": "Maintenance charges are levied by the facility management team to cover common area upkeep, security, power backup, and cleaning services. These costs typically range from Rs 18 to Rs 25 per sq ft per month, although this can vary between developers and the level of amenities provided in the complex. It is important to factor this into your overall return calculation, especially if the shop is currently vacant."

        "answer": "Both options in Sector 65 offer unique advantages.

      },
      {
        "question": "Is lockable or non-lockable shop space a better investment choice",
        "answer": "Lockable shop spaces provide maximum security and are generally preferred by retailers requiring dedicated storage and private access, leading to higher valuations and tenant retention. Non-lockable spaces, often found in food courts or shared retail areas, may offer better rental yields initially but often face higher tenant turnover. Lockable shops offer greater flexibility for potential self-use in the future."
