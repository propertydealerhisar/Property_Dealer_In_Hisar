Depending on the shop’s size, its location within the complex, and the specific tenant profile, investors can typically expect yields ranging from 6% to 9%.

      {
        "question": "Is it safe to invest in under-construction commercial projects in this sector",

        "answer": "The Southern Peripheral Road SPR is a critical, high-traffic arterial road that conveniently links NH-48 to the Golf Course Extension Road. This direct connectivity translates into phenomenal visibility for commercial projects located nearby. Enhanced visibility means higher customer footfall and a wider geographic reach for your retail business, ensuring that your shop is continuously exposed to both local Sector 67A residents and transit traffic passing through Gurugram."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of businesses thrive best in Sector 67A commercial spaces",
        "answer": "Sector 67A is ideally suited for businesses that cater directly to the affluent, high-spending residential population in the surrounding areas. High-demand segments typically include fine dining and casual dining restaurants, specialty gourmet grocery stores, high-end beauty salons, specialized clinics, modern fitness centers, and established branded fashion outlets.

      {
        "question": "Are there any maintenance charges associated with owning a shop here",

These charges cover essential shared services such as security personnel, common area cleaning, central power backup, elevator maintenance, and overall facility management.

        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for leasing a retail unit in this area",

        "question": "How important is frontage and floor location when selecting a shop",

Ground floor units featuring wide main road frontage command the highest premium due to maximum consumer visibility and easiest access. Upper-floor units, while generally cheaper, are better suited for non-retail services like clinics, professional offices, or destination-based services such as large food courts or entertainment zones."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize the purchase of a shop for sale",

      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I expect commercial property values to appreciate in Sector 67A",
        "answer": "Commercial property value appreciation in rapidly developing areas like Sector 67A is generally faster and more aggressive than in older, already saturated markets.

This appreciation is directly and positively linked to infrastructural completion and the successful absorption of the massive residential catchment population."
