    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical price range for a shop for sale in Sector 67 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The pricing for commercial shops in Sector 67 varies significantly based on factors such as the complex location floor level visibility and the unit size. Ground floor units on the main frontage naturally command the highest prices often starting from INR 18000 per square foot and going upwards. Smaller units or those on upper floors particularly dedicated office or service floors can be more affordably priced. We recommend speaking with our investment advisors for the most accurate and up-to-date pricing list for specific projects in the sector."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of rental yield should I expect from a commercial shop in Sector 67",
        "answer": "Sector 67 is known for offering robust rental yields generally ranging between 6% to 8% depending on whether the property is new or pre-leased and the quality of the tenant. Pre-leased shops with long lock-in periods and stable tenants often offer yields at the higher end of this spectrum providing instant positive cash flow. Factors like location within the complex and proximity to anchor stores directly impact the achievable rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any risks associated with investing in new commercial projects in Sector 67",
        "answer": "Investing in any commercial property carries standard market risks but risks are mitigated in Sector 67 due to high demand and RERA compliance. The main risks often involve potential delays in project completion or difficulty in finding a tenant for unleased spaces upon handover. We recommend investing in RERA-registered projects with established developers and considering pre-leased options to completely eliminate tenancy risk and ensure timely delivery."
      },
      {
        "question": "How important is the specific location of the shop within the complex",
        "answer": "The shop's location within the complex is critically important arguably more so than the overall location of the sector itself. Shops facing the main road those near the entrance or those adjacent to anchor tenants or escalators receive significantly higher footfall and command substantially higher rents. A marginally more expensive shop in a prime internal location will almost always outperform a cheaper shop tucked away in a low-visibility corner."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I focus on buying a pre-leased shop or an unleased shop for maximum returns",
        "answer": "The decision depends entirely on your investment goal. A pre-leased shop offers immediate income and zero vacancy risk making it ideal for income-focused investors prioritizing stability. An unleased shop generally requires slightly lower capital outlay and offers the potential for higher capital appreciation once a tenant is secured at a premium rate often suiting investors with a higher risk appetite and longer holding period."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common maintenance charges and fees for commercial properties here",
        "answer": "Commercial properties in Sector 67 typically involve common area maintenance CAM charges often billed monthly or quarterly. These charges cover security cleaning common utilities upkeep of elevators and building management services. CAM charges usually range from INR 15 to INR 30 per square foot per month depending on the level of amenities and services provided by the specific commercial society."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the future potential for capital appreciation in Sector 67 commercial real estate",
        "answer": "The future potential is very strong due to the sector's strategic position on the developing Golf Course Extension Road corridor and the limited supply of high-quality retail space catering to a rapidly growing affluent population. As the surrounding residential and corporate catchments reach full occupancy we expect substantial capital appreciation in commercial assets over the next five to ten years making it a strong long-term investment holding."

      {
