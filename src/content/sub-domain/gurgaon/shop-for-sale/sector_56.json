      {
        "question": "What is the typical price range for a commercial shop in Sector 56 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The pricing for a shop for sale in Sector 56 varies significantly based on factors like size, floor level, project reputation, and frontage visibility. Generally, ground floor high-street units start from approximately INR 15,000 to INR 25,000 per square foot.

      {
        "question": "What kind of return on investment ROI can I expect from a shop in Sector 56",
        "answer": "Sector 56 is known for delivering healthy ROIs, primarily through both rental yield and capital appreciation. Typical gross rental yields hover between 5% and 8% annually depending on tenant quality and lease terms. Capital appreciation has historically been robust, often exceeding 10% per annum due to the area’s continuous development and increasing residential density.
