    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What are the typical service charges or commission rates for Real Estate Agents in New Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Commission structures in New Gurgaon vary depending on the type of transaction—sale, purchase, or leasing—and the property value.

It is crucial to clarify the commission structure and all associated costs upfront with your Real Estate Agent in New Gurgaon before signing any service agreement to ensure complete transparency and avoid hidden fees later in the process."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I verify the credentials and RERA status of a property agent in Gurugram",
        "answer": "To ensure you are working with a legitimate and compliant professional, you must verify their RERA registration number. The Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority H R E R A maintains an online database where you can search for the agent or agency using their name or RERA ID.

      {
        "question": "Is New Gurgaon a good long-term investment location compared to Central Gurugram",
        "answer": "Yes, New Gurgaon offers superior long-term growth potential due to its focus on planned infrastructure and better connectivity projects like the Dwarka Expressway and extended metro lines. While Central Gurugram D L F Phase 1 to 5 is saturated and expensive, New Gurgaon sectors 80 to 95 are still maturing.

      },
      {
        "question": "What due diligence should my Real Estate Agent conduct before I purchase a property",
        "answer": "A reliable Real Estate Agent in New Gurgaon should perform extensive due diligence including verifying the title deed ownership history, checking for any existing encumbrances or loans on the property, confirming zoning regulations, and reviewing the Occupancy Certificate O C or Completion Certificate C C for ready-to-move projects. For under-construction projects, they must verify the RERA registration of the developer and the stage of project approval from relevant authorities before proceeding."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes the Dwarka Expressway corridor in New Gurgaon particularly attractive right now",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can a real estate agent help me secure financing or a home loan",

      },
      {
        "question": "Should I hire an exclusive agent for buying property in New Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Hiring an exclusive Real Estate Agent means that agent is solely dedicated to finding you the best property without conflict of interest. This often leads to superior service, access to exclusive listings, and personalized negotiation strategies. While some prefer to work with multiple agents, an exclusive arrangement ensures the agent invests maximum time and resources into meeting your precise requirements within the competitive New Gurgaon market."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should I communicate my property requirements effectively to my chosen agent",

      },
      {
        "question": "What are the key differences between investing in plots versus apartments in New Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Plots typically offer higher capital appreciation rates and greater flexibility for construction, but they require a longer holding period and higher liquidity risk. Apartments, especially in reputable complexes, offer immediate rental income and greater security, making them lower risk. Your Real Estate Agent should advise based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, highlighting the regulations governing plotted developments in the area."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the projected rental yield in the prominent sectors of New Gurgaon",
        "answer": "Rental yields in premium sectors of New Gurgaon like those along the S P R generally range between 2.5% to 4% annually for residential properties, depending on the builder and the amenities offered.
