However, there are limited opportunities for new construction, usually resulting from the redevelopment of older plots into modern builder floor apartments offering better amenities. Our real estate agents monitor all such redevelopment cycles and maintain relationships with reputable local builders ensuring you have access to brand new inventory as soon as it is launched avoiding long waiting lists and securing prime units."
