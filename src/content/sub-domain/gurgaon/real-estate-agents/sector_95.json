You can cross-verify this number directly on the official Haryana RERA website by searching the authorized agents section. This step is critically important as RERA compliance guarantees a certain level of ethical conduct, accountability, and legal transparency in all dealings handled by the real estate agent in Sector 95."

A professional real estate agent helps assess this by providing detailed reports on anticipated capital appreciation rates, comparing localized growth to adjacent sectors like 92 and 93, and offering insights into the demographics driving future demand for residential and rental units in the area."
      },
      {
        "question": "What legal documents should a real estate agent help me verify before buying a flat in Sector 95",
