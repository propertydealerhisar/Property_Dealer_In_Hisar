    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical commission rate for Real Estate Agents in Sector 25 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Commission rates in prime locations like Sector 25 are generally negotiable but adhere to standard industry practices. For property sales, agents typically charge between 1 to 2 percent of the total transaction value from each party (buyer and seller). For rental transactions, the fee usually equates to one month's rent. Transparency is key, and it is crucial to finalise the agreed-upon rate in writing before any engagement begins to avoid disputes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I verify the credentials of a property agent operating in Sector 25",
        "answer": "Always request proof of their RERA registration number and check its validity on the official Haryana RERA website. Additionally, ask for evidence of recent successful transactions specifically in Sector 25 or adjacent luxury sectors. A reputable agent should happily provide client references and details of their professional affiliations and experience in high-value properties."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are residential plots still available for sale in Sector 25 Gurugram",
        "answer": "Yes, residential plots are available, but they are extremely scarce and highly prized due to the area's development and prime connectivity. Inventory turnover is slow, and plots often command a significant premium. Working with established Real Estate Agents in Sector 25 is essential as they often maintain lists of potential sellers who are considering listing their plots soon."
      },
      {
        "question": "What property types are most common in Sector 25 besides plots",
        "answer": "Sector 25 primarily features high-end independent builder floors, luxury duplex apartments, and custom-built residential villas. Given its proximity to corporate hubs, there is also limited availability of premium serviced apartments and high-end residential complex units managed by reputed developers. Agents can guide you through the pros and cons of investing in each type."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I use an exclusive agent contract for buying property in this sector",
        "answer": "Using an exclusive agent contract is highly recommended in a competitive market like Sector 25. An exclusive arrangement ensures the agent dedicates more time, resources, and often grants you access to their proprietary network of off-market listings. In return, you commit to working only with them for a fixed period, which often leads to a more focused and faster property search outcome."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation should a seller prepare before listing a property in Sector 25",
        "answer": "Sellers should prepare clear copies of the Sale Deed, Mother Deed, all relevant Title Documents, proof of property tax payments up to date, completion certificate, and occupation certificate for constructed properties. Agents will conduct a thorough documentation audit early in the process to pre-empt any legal issues that could delay the final sale process significantly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does an agent determine the valuation of my existing Sector 25 property",
        "answer": "Top agents use a comprehensive Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) approach. This involves evaluating recent sales data for similar properties (comparables) within the immediate vicinity of Sector 25, factoring in the property's size, age, condition, amenities, and specific location features like road facing or park proximity. They adjust valuations based on current market sentiment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 25 a good area for rental income investment in Gurugram",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Sector 25 is situated near Cyber City, making it a highly desirable residential choice for senior corporate executives and expatriates who demand premium housing. Rental yields are robust, and tenant quality is typically very high. Real Estate Agents in Sector 25 are experts in securing reliable tenants quickly and managing lease agreements efficiently."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the hidden costs I should discuss with my agent before closing a deal",
        "answer": "Ensure you discuss stamp duty and registration fees, property tax adjustments, society maintenance charges if applicable, lawyer fees, and any potential utility transfer charges. A reliable agent provides a detailed cost sheet encompassing all statutory and administrative fees associated with the transaction, ensuring complete financial clarity from the start."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can agents assist with property development and construction advice in Sector 25",
        "answer": "Many high-end Real Estate Agents in Sector 25 maintain strong networks with reputable architects, builders, and interior designers operating specifically in Gurugram's luxury market. While they are not builders themselves, they can introduce you to trusted professionals to manage the entire process of custom-building or renovation effectively."
