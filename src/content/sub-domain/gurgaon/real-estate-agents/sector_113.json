        "question": "What is the typical brokerage fee charged by Real Estate Agents in Sector 113 for residential sales transactions",
        "answer": "The standard brokerage fee in Gurugram, including Sector 113, typically ranges from 1% to 2% of the total property value, payable by both the buyer and the seller.

      {
        "question": "How do local agents assess the fair market value of property in Sector 113",
        "answer": "Our expert Real Estate Agents in Sector 113 use a comprehensive valuation methodology. This includes analyzing comparable sales data (Comps) from the last six months within the same society or vicinity, assessing the age and condition of the building, checking the floor level, and evaluating current infrastructure development progress in the sector.

        "question": "Is Sector 113 a better investment choice than older Gurugram sectors like Cyber City or Golf Course Road",
        "answer": "Sector 113 offers a strong competitive edge primarily due to its strategic location along the Dwarka Expressway and the advantage of new infrastructure. While older sectors command higher current rentals, Sector 113 provides significantly higher potential for capital appreciation over the next five to ten years as connectivity improves and the population density increases. Investors often prefer Sector 113 for its modern societies, superior planning, and lower entry point compared to established luxury areas."
