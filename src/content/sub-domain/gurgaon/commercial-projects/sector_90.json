      {
        "question": "What is the expected rental yield from commercial projects in this sector",
        "answer": "While rental yields vary significantly based on the type of asset and the developer, commercial projects in prime locations in Sector 90 currently offer projected rental yields typically ranging between 6% to 8% annually for well-managed, high-street retail spaces. Lockable office spaces usually fall slightly lower, around 5% to 7%. These yields are considered robust for an emerging market.

      {
        "question": "Are there any specific risks associated with investing in New Gurgaon commercial real estate like Sector 90",
        "answer": "As with any emerging real estate market, the primary risk involves project completion delays, although this is mitigated significantly by partnering with RERA-registered, reputable developers. Market saturation could be a concern if too many projects launch simultaneously, but Sector 90’s immense residential catchment area provides a natural hedge against low occupancy. We mitigate risk for our clients by conducting rigorous due diligence on developer track records, checking financial stability, and selecting projects with clear execution timelines and strong leasing track records in their previous developments."

Acquisition costs for retail and office spaces here can be 30% to 50% lower than prime locations like Cyber City, Golf Course Road, or established parts of Sohna Road. While the rental yields might slightly trail the most premium locations today, the scope for capital appreciation in Sector 90 is substantially higher due to the lower entry barrier and ongoing infrastructure improvements, positioning it as a value investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is commercial property in Sector 90 suitable for small business owners or only large investors",
