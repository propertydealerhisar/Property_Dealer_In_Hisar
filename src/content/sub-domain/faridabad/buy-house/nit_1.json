It provides immediate access to the main Mathura Road NH-19 and is served by the Delhi Metro’s Violet Line at nearby stations like Ajronda and Neelam Chowk. This level of connectivity is often unmatched by newer, peripheral sectors which require longer commutes and reliance on less developed public transport infrastructure.

      {
        "question": "What are the average maintenance costs associated with properties in NIT 1",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is it better to buy an old house and renovate or buy a new builder floor in NIT 1",
        "answer": "The decision depends entirely on your budget and timeline. Buying an older house provides greater plot area at a potentially lower per square yard price, giving you flexibility for a massive custom renovation, but this requires time and effort. Buying a new builder floor offers immediate possession, modern construction standards, and often better access to amenities, making it a faster, stress-free option for immediate occupancy."
