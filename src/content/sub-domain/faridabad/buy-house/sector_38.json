Always confirm the title status during the initial documentation review to ensure full clarity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How old is the residential development in Sector 38 generally",
        "answer": "Sector 38 is considered a relatively established and mature residential sector, with development spanning the last one to two decades. While some older, original homes exist, there has been a significant surge in redevelopment and new construction in recent years, especially modern builder floors and independent villas, meaning buyers can choose between brand-new structures or well-maintained older properties."
