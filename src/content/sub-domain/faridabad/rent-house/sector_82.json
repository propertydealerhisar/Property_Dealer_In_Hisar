        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Sector 82 Faridabad generally ranges from two to three months' rent, depending on the house type and the landlord's preference. For premium independent houses or fully furnished units, some landlords may request up to four months' rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the lease term, subject to property inspection and deduction for any damages beyond normal wear and tear. Always verify the exact deposit amount and refund conditions in the rental agreement."

For established families or multinational company executives, two-year lease agreements with a yearly escalation clause are also common. Shorter-term leases, typically three to six months, are rare and usually command a slightly higher monthly rent to compensate for the quick turnover."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is public transportation easily accessible from the residential areas of Sector 82",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 82 is well-served by public transport. While the nearest major Metro station requires a short commute, local connectivity is strong. Auto-rickshaws, shared taxis, and local city buses frequently operate along the main roads, providing easy access to commercial centers and the main Faridabad transportation hubs. Many residents also rely on app-based cab services for convenience."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses in Sector 82 properties",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly across different house types and landlords in Sector 82. Independent houses or ground-floor units are more likely to permit pets, especially dogs or cats, compared to properties within integrated residential societies. It is crucial to confirm the pet policy explicitly with the landlord before renting, as an undisclosed pet could lead to lease termination or penalties."

      {
        "question": "What are the typical maintenance charges for renting an independent house here",
        "answer": "For independent houses in Sector 82, external maintenance such as security or common area cleaning is often handled by the local RWA and billed separately, usually ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 per month depending on the facilities. Internal maintenance of the house, however, is typically the tenant's responsibility as per the lease agreement, covering minor repairs and wear and tear."

      },
      {
        "question": "Are semi-furnished or fully furnished rental houses more common in this area",
        "answer": "Semi-furnished houses are the most common rental option in Sector 82. These units usually include fitted modular kitchens, wardrobes in bedrooms, and basic light fixtures. Fully furnished luxury units are available but make up a smaller segment of the market and attract a higher rental premium to cover the cost and maintenance of appliances and furniture."
      },

        "question": "What documentation is needed to rent a house as a professional in Faridabad",
        "answer": "As a professional, you will typically need a valid government-issued ID proof such as an Aadhar Card or Passport, PAN Card, proof of current employment or salary slips, and recent bank statements. For company leases, relevant company documentation and authorized signatory proof are required. All tenants must submit these documents for mandatory police verification."
      },
