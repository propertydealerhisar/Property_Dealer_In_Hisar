While many landlords in independent houses are accommodating, it is crucial to clarify the pet policy before finalizing the lease. Some may permit pets but require a higher security deposit or include specific clauses regarding damage caused by animals. We always check the pet allowance status and negotiate terms on your behalf to ensure a smooth agreement."

Tenants are typically responsible for all utility bills including electricity consumption, water charges (unless specified otherwise by the municipality), and gas connections.

Always confirm the exact utility payment structure before signing the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a rented house in Sector 21C",
        "answer": "The speed of moving in depends on the property’s readiness and the time required for documentation. If the house is vacant and ready for immediate possession, the process can often be completed within three to seven working days, provided all background checks and security deposit transfers are finalized. Our team streamlines the paperwork to minimize delays, ensuring a rapid and efficient handover of keys so you can settle into your new home swiftly."
