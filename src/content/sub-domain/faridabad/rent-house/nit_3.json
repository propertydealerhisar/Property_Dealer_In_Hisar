        "answer": "The most common lease duration for residential properties in NIT 3 Faridabad is 11 months which is legally executed under a notarized rent agreement. This agreement typically includes a clause for mutual renewal or extension upon completion of the term. Landlords generally prefer the 11-month structure to avoid the complexities associated with registering a full one-year lease which requires higher stamp duty. Always ensure the agreement clearly defines rent escalation clauses maintenance responsibilities and the security deposit refund policy before signing."

        "question": "How much security deposit is usually required for homes in this area",

This deposit is collected upfront at the time of signing the agreement and is held by the landlord until the tenant vacates the property. It serves as security against potential damages to the property or failure to pay rent or utility bills. We strongly advise tenants to conduct a thorough move-in inspection and document the property's condition photographically to ensure a smooth deposit refund process upon departure."
