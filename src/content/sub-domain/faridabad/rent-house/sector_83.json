        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Sector 83 usually ranges from one to two months’ rent, depending on the type of property and the landlord’s preference. For highly furnished apartments or premium villas, landlords might occasionally ask for a three-month deposit.

Always ensure the deposit terms are clearly documented in the lease agreement before making any payment."

      {
        "question": "Are independent houses or builder floors more common for rent than apartments in Sector 83",
        "answer": "While Sector 83 has a mix of housing types, independent builder floors are exceptionally popular for rent. These offer a desirable balance of privacy, spaciousness, and modern design, often being preferred by families over crowded high-rise complexes.

Your choice depends entirely on your need for amenities versus privacy."
      },
      {

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for registering the lease agreement officially in Faridabad",
        "answer": "The lease agreement must be officially registered with the Sub-Registrar’s office to be legally valid and admissible in court.
