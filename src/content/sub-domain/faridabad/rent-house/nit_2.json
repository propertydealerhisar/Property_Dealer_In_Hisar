    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a house rental agreement in NIT 2 Faridabad",
        "answer": "To secure a rent house in NIT 2, tenants typically need to provide copies of their Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and proof of employment or current income documentation like salary slips or bank statements. Landlords usually require two sets of passport-sized photographs. For added legal security, the lease agreement itself should be officially registered or notarized, ensuring all terms and conditions are legally binding for the defined tenancy period."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard notice period for vacating a rental house in this area",
        "answer": "The standard notice period in NIT 2, as is common across most of Faridabad, is one or two months. This period allows the landlord adequate time to find a new tenant without loss of income. It is absolutely essential to clearly define this notice period within the signed lease agreement, detailing penalties or exceptions for early termination of the contract by either the tenant or the landlord."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility connections like electricity and water included in the rent price for houses",
        "answer": "No, utility charges such as electricity, water, and gas are almost universally separate from the monthly rent price for independent houses in NIT 2. Tenants are usually responsible for paying these bills based on consumption directly to the service providers. Landlords will typically transfer or provide access to the meter readings and connections upon move-in, sometimes requiring a separate utility deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "How reliable is the public transport and Metro connectivity near NIT 2 Faridabad",
        "answer": "Public transport connectivity is one of the major draws of renting a house in NIT 2. The locality enjoys easy access to the nearest Metro Station on the Violet Line, providing seamless travel to Delhi and key areas of NCR. Furthermore, local buses, share autos, and cycle-rickshaws are readily available, making intra-Faridabad travel inexpensive and highly convenient throughout the day."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and general maintenance of a rented house",
        "answer": "Responsibility for repairs is usually divided. Tenants are typically accountable for minor day-to-day maintenance and small repairs like electrical bulb replacements or faucet leaks up to a specified monetary limit per incident. The landlord is generally responsible for major structural repairs, plumbing overhauls, and external painting or damage caused by natural wear and tear, provided the lease clearly states these divisions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I keep pets in a rent house in NIT 2",
        "answer": "The allowance of pets is strictly dependent on the individual landlord’s preference and must be clarified before finalizing the rental agreement. While many independent house owners in NIT 2 are agreeable to small, well-behaved pets, others strictly prohibit them. If pets are allowed, expect to pay a slightly higher security deposit to cover potential damages."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical annual rent increase expected in NIT 2",
        "answer": "For renewed leases, the standard annual rent increase in NIT 2, Faridabad, generally falls between 5% and 10% of the previous year's rent. This figure should always be specified in the initial rental agreement to prevent disputes. High demand or significant property upgrades might push this closer to the 10% mark, but major, unexpected hikes are rare if the agreement is clearly defined."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there good schools and hospitals accessible from NIT 2",
        "answer": "Absolutely. NIT 2 is a mature residential area ensuring excellent proximity to recognized schools like DAV Public School and numerous government and private institutions. For healthcare, major hospitals and specialized clinics are located within a short driving distance, providing high-quality medical services readily available to residents."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I inspect during the final property walk-through before moving in",
        "answer": "During the final walk-through of your new rent house in NIT 2, meticulously check all electrical wiring, ensure all water taps and drainage systems are functional, verify the condition of walls and paint, and confirm that all agreed-upon fixtures like geysers and ACs are operational. Documenting the pre-existing condition with photographs is highly recommended to protect your security deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to rent a house in NIT 2 without using a professional broker or platform",
        "answer": "While it is possible to rent directly, using a professional platform significantly mitigates risk. Brokers and platforms like ours ensure legal scrutiny of documents, accurate background checks on property owners, and clarity on lease terms, offering a layer of protection against scams and unexpected issues that often arise when dealing directly in a high-demand market like NIT 2 Faridabad."
