    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental price range for a 2 BHK house in Sector 22 Faridabad",
        "answer": "The rental rates in Sector 22 are highly competitive, reflecting the area's excellent location and amenities. Generally, a good quality semi-furnished 2 BHK unit can range between ₹12,000 and ₹18,000 per month, depending heavily on the precise location, age of construction, and whether it is an independent floor or part of a multi-storey building. Fully furnished or newly constructed properties may command rates higher than this range. It is advisable to factor in additional costs like maintenance charges and utility bills too."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a rental agreement in Sector 22",
        "answer": "To legally secure a house to rent in Sector 22, tenants must provide standard identity and address proof. Required documents typically include Aadhar Card and PAN Card copies for all adult occupants. Employment verification documents or bank statements might also be requested by the landlord. We ensure all paperwork is properly executed, including the registered Rent Agreement, which is mandatory for police verification in Faridabad."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses or builder floors more common to rent in this sector",
        "answer": "While independent houses and traditional kothis exist, builder floors are increasingly common and popular for renting in Sector 22. Builder floors offer modern designs, better security, and independent utility meters, appealing to contemporary tenants. Independent houses offer more space but might be older constructions. We list both types extensively, allowing you to choose based on your preference for modern design versus overall size."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long is the standard lock-in period for rental properties here",
        "answer": "Most standard rental agreements in Sector 22 impose an 11-month lease term with a mutual lock-in period of typically 6 months. This means neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the agreement before 6 months without incurring a penalty, usually equivalent to one or two months' rent. Longer lease terms are negotiable, especially for corporate clients or those committed to a multi-year stay."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common security deposit requirements in Sector 22 rentals",
        "answer": "Landlords in Sector 22 generally request a security deposit equivalent to two months' rent. This deposit is held to cover any potential damages or outstanding utility bills at the end of the tenancy. The security deposit must be clearly stated in the rental agreement, outlining the conditions for its full refund upon vacating the premises, assuming the property is returned in good condition."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking easily available when I rent house in Sector 22",
        "answer": "Parking availability varies by property type. Most modern builder floors offer dedicated stilt parking for one car. Independent houses usually provide ample space within the property boundary or porch area. If you are renting a multi-story apartment floor, check specifically whether the rental includes an assigned parking spot, as street parking can sometimes be competitive in dense areas of the sector."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental houses in Sector 22 Faridabad",
        "answer": "Pet policies are strictly determined by individual landlords. While some property owners are accommodating, especially in independent houses with private yards, many apartment and builder floor owners maintain a no-pet policy due to potential wear and tear or society rules. It is crucial to inform us upfront if you have pets so we can filter listings that are pet-friendly before you plan to visit any location."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is included in the monthly maintenance charges",
        "answer": "Maintenance charges, if applicable, usually cover shared expenses such as common area electricity, cleaning of stairs and shared lobbies, security guard salaries, and basic repairs of shared infrastructure. For independent builder floors, maintenance might be minimal or handled directly by the tenant and co-tenants. Always clarify with the landlord exactly what services the monthly fee covers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How reliable is the water and electricity supply in Sector 22",
        "answer": "Sector 22 enjoys reliable civic infrastructure. Electricity supply is generally stable, although many properties have inverter backup or generator facilities to handle rare outages. Water supply is typically consistent, provided by the municipal corporation, often supplemented by underground tanks in larger houses. Power backup is highly recommended, especially during the summer months."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the monthly rent with the landlord in Sector 22",
        "answer": "Yes, negotiation is a standard part of the rental process, though the extent depends on market conditions, the property’s demand, and the duration of your intended lease. Properties that have been vacant for some time offer more room for negotiation. We assist our clients in presenting strong offers to secure the best possible monthly rent when they decide to rent house in Sector 22."
