    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required when I Rent House in NIT 1 Faridabad",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit for independent house rentals in NIT 1 usually ranges between one to two months’ worth of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is held by the landlord throughout the tenancy period and is fully refundable upon vacating the premises, provided there is no significant damage beyond typical wear and tear and all utility bills are settled. Premium or fully furnished properties might sometimes require a slightly higher deposit, often negotiable, depending on the specific fixtures and appliances included in the agreement."

Semi-furnished properties usually include basic permanent fixtures like built-in wardrobes, kitchen cabinetry, and bathroom fittings. Fully furnished options are available but tend to command a premium rent and are preferred by those needing immediate move-in without purchasing furniture."

        "question": "Is parking usually available with independent house rentals in this locality",

Major structural repairs, waterproofing issues, or replacement of large appliances (if provided by the landlord) usually fall under the owner’s responsibility. Clear delineation of these responsibilities is established upfront in the legal lease document."

      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in independent rental houses in NIT 1 Faridabad",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by the house owner in NIT 1, as there is no universal housing society rule. Many landlords of independent houses are more accommodating toward responsible pet owners compared to apartment societies. It is crucial to inform us upfront if you have pets so we can exclusively filter properties where pets are explicitly permitted, often requiring a specific pet clause in the rental agreement."
      },
      {
