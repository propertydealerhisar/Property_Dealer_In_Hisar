        "answer": "Most standard rent agreements include a lock-in period often six months during which neither party can terminate the lease without severe penalty. After the lock-in period if a tenant wishes to vacate they are usually required to give a notice period typically one to two months as specified in the agreement failing which a penalty equivalent to the notice period rent may be deducted from the security deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rental price for a house in Sector 75",
