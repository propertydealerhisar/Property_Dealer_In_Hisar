      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental agreement duration for houses in Sector 21D",
        "answer": "Most landlords in Sector 21D prefer a standard 11-month or 12-month lease agreement. For premium properties and corporate tenants, two-year leases with a lock-in period are also common. We always ensure the agreement clearly specifies renewal terms and the standard annual rental escalation rate, which is typically between 5% and 10% depending on the property type and current market conditions. Transparency in duration is key to a stable tenancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average security deposit required to Rent House in Sector 21D",
        "answer": "The security deposit in this affluent sector usually ranges from two to three months' worth of rent. This amount is held by the landlord throughout the tenancy and is refundable upon the expiry of the lease, contingent on the property being returned without undue damage. We strongly recommend documenting the initial condition of the house through detailed photographs and inventory checklists to avoid disputes upon exit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 21D generally furnished semi-furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "Due to the high demand for long-term family rentals, most independent houses are offered as semi-furnished. This usually includes modular kitchen fittings, built-in wardrobes, lighting fixtures, and air conditioning units in primary rooms. Fully furnished luxury options are available but tend to command a higher premium, whereas completely unfurnished options are rarer but allow maximum personalization."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 21D considered a safe area for families and children",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 21D is widely recognized as one of the safest and most elite residential areas in Faridabad.

      },
      {
        "question": "What utility costs are typically borne by the tenant in Sector 21D rental houses",
        "answer": "As is standard practice for independent house rentals, the tenant is responsible for all consumable utility costs. This includes electricity based on meter reading, water usage, internet and DTH services, and gas connections. In some cases, the landlord may cover property taxes, but tenants should clarify who pays for the annual maintenance charges for common area services if applicable."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the availability of parking when renting an independent house here",
        "answer": "A significant advantage of choosing to Rent House in Sector 21D is the ample dedicated parking. Almost all independent houses offer private, covered parking space for at least one or two cars within the property compound or dedicated parking apron. Street parking is generally safe but the private garage facility remains a major draw for this locality."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close is Sector 21D to the nearest Delhi Metro station",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rented houses in Sector 21D",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by each landlord. Because Sector 21D properties are independent houses with private outdoor spaces, many owners are more accommodating to pets compared to apartment societies. However, strict adherence to pet conduct rules and property damage liability clauses will be required. Always disclose pet ownership upfront during the negotiation phase."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common maintenance responsibilities expected of the tenant",
        "answer": "Tenants are typically responsible for day-to-day minor maintenance, such as changing light bulbs, clearing minor plumbing blockages, and maintaining the cleanliness of the interior and private garden space. Major structural repairs, external painting, and significant electrical or plumbing failures caused by wear and tear are usually the landlord’s responsibility. Clear communication is essential."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the monthly rent for houses in Sector 21D",
        "answer": "Negotiation is often possible, especially if you commit to a longer lease period or if you have an excellent tenant profile. While premium properties have less room for negotiation, offering to pay several months' rent in advance or proposing a small escalation after the first year can be useful negotiation tactics. Our agents are skilled at mediating these discussions for the best outcome."
