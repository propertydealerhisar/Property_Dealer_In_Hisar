    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required when I rent a house in Sector 55",
        "answer": "Generally, landlords in Sector 55 require a security deposit equivalent to two or three months' rent. This amount is refundable upon the termination of your lease, provided there is no significant damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear. We always ensure this condition is clearly stipulated in the lease agreement, protecting your financial interests. The exact deposit amount may vary depending on the furnishing status of the house and the landlord’s specific policies, but we negotiate the best standard terms for our clients during the final agreement phase."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses in Sector 55 usually furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "Sector 55 offers a balanced mix of both fully furnished and unfurnished independent houses. Unfurnished houses provide tenants maximum flexibility to bring their own furniture and personalize the space. Semi-furnished options typically include essential fittings like modular kitchens, wardrobes, and basic lighting fixtures. Fully furnished houses are ideal for immediate move-ins and professionals, offering everything from white goods to furniture. When you browse our listings, you can easily filter properties based on their furnishing status to meet your specific requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the average rent for a 3 BHK independent house in Sector 55",
        "answer": "Rental rates in Sector 55 are highly dependent on the plot size, the age of construction, interior finishes, and proximity to main roads or parks. Currently, the average rent for a well-maintained 3 BHK independent house or builder floor typically ranges between INR 20,000 and INR 35,000 per month. Luxury Kothis or newly constructed independent homes with premium amenities might command higher rents. We provide up-to-date market analysis to ensure you receive a competitive and fair rental rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is maintenance handled for independent rental houses",
        "answer": "For independent houses, routine maintenance like cleaning and minor repairs are generally the responsibility of the tenant. Major structural repairs, issues related to plumbing leaks outside the house, or electrical faults in common areas are usually the responsibility of the landlord. The lease agreement precisely defines the demarcation of responsibilities between the tenant and the property owner, ensuring no confusion arises during your tenancy period. We review this clause thoroughly before signing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 55 well-connected via public transport options",
        "answer": "Yes Sector 55 boasts excellent connectivity. It is strategically located near the major National Highway access points making road travel very convenient. While Sector 55 does not have its own metro station, it is closely connected to the operational metro line stations in neighboring sectors, providing quick access to central Faridabad and Delhi. Local auto-rickshaws and app-based cabs are readily available, ensuring seamless commuting options for residents traveling to work or educational institutions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation do I need to secure a rental agreement",
        "answer": "To finalize a rental agreement, tenants typically need to provide government-issued identity proof such as Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of current residence, and often salary slips or employment verification documents for working professionals. We manage all the necessary paperwork, ensuring the lease agreement is notarized and registered legally, protecting both the tenant and the landlord throughout the duration of the stay."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets allowed in independent rental houses in Sector 55 Faridabad",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by the property owners in Sector 55. Since these are independent houses, many landlords are more flexible regarding pet ownership compared to apartment complexes. However, it is essential to disclose pet details upfront. We specifically list properties that are pet-friendly, or we negotiate pet clauses with the landlord, which sometimes involves a slightly increased security deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I inspect before finalizing a rental house agreement",
        "answer": "Before signing the lease, you must inspect the house thoroughly. Key checks include ensuring all electrical points and fixtures are functional, water pressure in bathrooms is adequate, the kitchen plumbing is leak-free, and general security features like locks and gates are secure. We provide a detailed move-in checklist to our clients and accompany you during the final inspection to ensure all minor repairs are addressed before handover."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long are typical lease agreements for houses in Sector 55",
        "answer": "The standard residential lease agreement in Sector 55 Faridabad is for 11 months, renewable thereafter. This 11-month structure helps both parties avoid lengthy registration processes sometimes associated with 12-month or longer agreements. However, if a tenant prefers a multi-year lease, we can facilitate that, though it usually requires formal registration and associated stamp duty payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the rent include utilities like water and electricity charges",
        "answer": "No generally the quoted monthly rent for independent houses in Sector 55 excludes utility charges. Tenants are responsible for paying their monthly electricity bills, water usage charges, and any internet or DTH connections directly based on consumption. The lease agreement will specify that meters are in the tenant's name or how consumption will be calculated if meters are shared."
