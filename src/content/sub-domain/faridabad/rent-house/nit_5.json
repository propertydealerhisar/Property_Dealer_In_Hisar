    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical rental cost for a 2 BHK house in NIT 5 Faridabad",
        "answer": "The typical rental cost for a standard 2 BHK independent floor or house in NIT 5 usually ranges between INR 12,000 and INR 18,000 per month, depending heavily on factors like the age of the property, proximity to the main road, furnishing level, and specific amenities such as parking or power backup. Larger and more modern builder floors near commercial hubs might command prices closer to the higher end of this range while older, interior-lane properties are more affordable. Always factor in additional costs like maintenance and utility bills when calculating your total monthly expenditure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses or builder floors more common to rent in NIT 5",
        "answer": "NIT 5, being a highly developed and established area, offers a balanced mix of both independent houses and purpose-built builder floors. Independent houses are prevalent in the older parts of the township and are preferred by those seeking more land area and privacy. However, newly constructed properties are typically vertical builder floors offering modern layouts and often better security features. The availability largely depends on the specific street or block within the NIT 5 locality."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a rental agreement in Faridabad",
        "answer": "To finalize a rental agreement for a house in NIT 5, tenants typically need to provide valid photo ID proofs such as an Aadhar Card or Passport, proof of employment or student status, and recent bank statements for verification. The lease agreement itself requires signing by both the tenant and the landlord, usually witnessed, and must be notarized or registered to be legally binding, protecting both parties throughout the lease term."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard security deposit requirement in NIT 5 rentals",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit requirement across Faridabad, including NIT 5, usually mandates paying an amount equivalent to two months of rent. This deposit is held by the landlord throughout the tenancy period and is refundable upon vacating the premises, provided the property is returned in good condition, minus any deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear or unpaid utility bills. Negotiation on this deposit amount is sometimes possible depending on the landlord and the lease duration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is NIT 5 considered a safe and family-friendly location for renting",
        "answer": "Yes, NIT 5 is widely considered one of the safer and more family-friendly residential areas in Central Faridabad. It is a dense, well-populated area with active community engagement and established policing presence due to its central location. Proximity to good schools and local parks makes it particularly appealing for families. While general urban caution is always advised, the neighborhood enjoys a relatively low crime rate and a strong community atmosphere."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close is NIT 5 to major transportation links like the Metro Station",
        "answer": "NIT 5 is exceptionally well-connected. The locality is serviced effectively by the Delhi Metro’s Violet Line. The closest stations are typically the Old Faridabad Metro Station and the Neelam Chowk Ajronda Metro Station, both usually accessible within a 10 to 15 minute drive or a short rickshaw ride. The main Mathura Road NH 19 also runs nearby, providing quick road connectivity to Delhi and Palwal."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration is common for rental houses in this part of Faridabad",
        "answer": "The most common lease duration for residential properties in NIT 5 is 11 months. This duration avoids the need for mandatory registration under certain local laws, making the process smoother. However, many landlords are open to signing a 12-month or longer lease if preferred by the tenant, particularly for corporate or long-term residents. Longer leases often include a fixed percentage increase in rent upon renewal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges typically included in the rent or separate",
        "answer": "For independent houses or older builder floors, maintenance charges are generally the tenant’s responsibility and are often paid separately as utility bills or minor repair costs. If renting a house within a modern gated society or a very recent builder floor project, there may be a fixed monthly maintenance fee included or stated separately, covering services like common area cleaning, lift operation, and shared security personnel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent a house in NIT 5 if I have pets",
        "answer": "Finding a pet-friendly rental house in NIT 5 is possible, but it requires specific searching. Many individual landlords are hesitant about pets due to potential damage or nuisance concerns. It is crucial to be upfront about having pets during the inquiry phase. Listings that explicitly state 'pets allowed' or 'negotiable' will be your best options, and you may be required to pay an increased security deposit to cover potential pet-related damages."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the procedure for property viewing and booking a rental house in NIT 5",
        "answer": "Our procedure is simple. Once you identify a property to rent house in NIT 5 from our website, you can request a viewing time via phone or form submission. Our dedicated property manager will coordinate with the landlord and accompany you to the site. If satisfied, you place a small token advance to hold the property, after which we proceed with documentation, background checks, and drafting the final lease agreement before collecting the full deposit."
