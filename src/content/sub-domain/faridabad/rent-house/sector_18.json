        "answer": "Sector 18 has a strong mix, but builder floors, particularly ground and first floor units, are extremely common and highly sought after for rent. Independent houses are available but generally demand a higher premium due to the exclusive access and larger overall property size they offer.

        "answer": "The standard security deposit when you rent a house in Sector 18 is typically two to three months worth of rent, which is refundable upon lease termination, subject to property condition checks. The standard lock-in period is six months, meaning the tenant cannot vacate the property before this time without forfeiting the deposit, though most lease agreements run for 11 months renewable annually."

        "answer": "Yes, Sector 18 is widely regarded as one of the safer and more affluent residential areas in Faridabad. The presence of an active RWA, well-lit streets, and controlled entry points in many internal lanes contribute to a secure environment. Landlords usually prioritize the safety of their tenants, especially in independent rental houses."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utilities like water supply and electricity stable in Sector 18 rental homes?",
        "answer": "Utility supply in Sector 18 is generally very stable compared to peripheral sectors. It receives reliable municipal water supply, and load shedding for electricity is rare. Most modern rental properties, especially high-end independent houses and builder floors, are already equipped with dedicated power backup systems (inverters or generators) to handle any brief outages."

        "question": "Can I find furnished or semi-furnished rental houses easily in this sector?",

      {
        "question": "Does Sector 18 have good parking facilities for tenants with multiple vehicles?",
        "answer": "Most independent houses and newer builder floor rental units in Sector 18 offer dedicated stilt or driveway parking spaces included in the rent. While street parking is generally available, renting a house that provides secure, internal parking is highly recommended, especially for families with more than one car."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the final rent price of a house in Sector 18?",
        "answer": "Key factors include the total built-up area and plot size, the age and finish quality of the construction, the specific floor level (ground floor units often cost more than second floors), the availability of power backup and dedicated parking, and whether the property is fully furnished or semi-furnished.
