    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for houses for rent in Sector 2",
        "answer": "Most residential rental agreements in Sector 2 Faridabad are executed for a minimum period of 11 months, which is renewable upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord. While some landlords may agree to shorter terms for corporate rentals, standard practice favors the 11-month lease to simplify stamp duty and registration processes. We always recommend reviewing the break clause terms clearly before signing, especially regarding early termination penalties."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is required when renting property here",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit required for a house for rent in Sector 2 generally ranges from one to three months’ rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy, provided there are no damages to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all utility bills are settled. The exact amount often depends on the property type (independent house versus builder floor) and whether it is furnished or unfurnished."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility costs included in the monthly rent in Sector 2",
        "answer": "No, generally utility costs are separate and must be paid directly by the tenant. Monthly rent typically covers only the base property usage. Tenants are usually responsible for electricity charges, water charges, internet bills, and gas connections. It is important to check if the property has a dedicated water meter and discuss the average monthly consumption with the landlord before finalizing the agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Sector 2 Faridabad a safe residential area for families",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 2 is widely regarded as one of the safer, more established residential sectors in Faridabad. It features well-lit streets, active resident welfare associations, and enjoys good proximity to police posts. The area’s design, largely consisting of independent houses, encourages strong community interaction, further enhancing overall security and peace of mind for families."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the process for maintenance and repairs in a rented house",
        "answer": "For routine minor maintenance, such as changing light bulbs or minor plumbing issues, the responsibility usually falls to the tenant. However, for major structural repairs, including leakage, electrical wiring defects, or significant property damage, the landlord is typically responsible. Our managed properties offer clear channels for reporting issues, ensuring timely resolution and professional contractor deployment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How close is Sector 2 to public transport options",
        "answer": "Sector 2 enjoys excellent connectivity to the Faridabad Metro network, with the nearest station being highly accessible. Additionally, auto-rickshaws, city buses, and app-based cabs frequently service the area, making commuting within Faridabad and to nearby Delhi seamless. This great accessibility is a primary reason why professionals prefer to rent house in Sector 2."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I keep pets if I rent a house in Sector 2",
        "answer": "Pet policies are determined individually by the landlord. Many independent house owners in Sector 2 are accommodating of small house pets, but it is crucial to clarify this upfront and receive written permission in the rental agreement. Failure to disclose pets can lead to complications later. Some landlords may request an additional, non-refundable pet deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there good schools near the rental homes in Sector 2",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Sector 2 is surrounded by some of Faridabad’s most reputed educational institutions, ranging from highly-rated primary schools to senior secondary institutions. This makes it an ideal location for families with children. The short commute times to schools greatly enhance the convenience of renting a house in this specific locality."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the advantages of renting an independent house versus a builder floor",
        "answer": "Renting an entire independent house offers maximum privacy, dedicated parking, and often a small garden area, giving you full control over the property. A builder floor, while also independent, is typically one unit within a multi-story building. Builder floors are usually more budget-friendly and newer, while independent houses offer more square footage and a traditional living experience."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required from the tenant to finalize the agreement",
        "answer": "To finalize the rental agreement for a house in Sector 2, tenants typically need to provide government-issued photo ID (Aadhar Card, Passport), address proof, PAN Card, and proof of employment or income (salary slips or bank statements). For corporate leases, company registration documents are required. Ensuring these documents are ready speeds up the leasing process considerably."
