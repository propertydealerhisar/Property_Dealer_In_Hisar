    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical security deposit required when I rent house in Sector 10 Faridabad",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit in Sector 10 usually ranges from two to three months’ equivalent rent. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided the property is returned in good condition, allowing for normal wear and tear. We negotiate clear clauses in the agreement detailing the refund timeline and any permissible deductions to ensure fairness for both tenant and landlord."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are independent houses for rent in Sector 10 generally furnished or unfurnished",
        "answer": "Sector 10 offers a diverse mix of rental options. Most independent houses are offered as semi-furnished, meaning they include essential fixtures like modular kitchen units, geysers, and wardrobes. Fully furnished houses are available but command a higher premium. Unfurnished options are also common, appealing to tenants who prefer to bring their own furniture and customize their living space entirely."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the standard lease duration for houses in Sector 10",
        "answer": "The most common and preferred lease duration for renting an independent house in Sector 10 is 11 months, which is renewable upon mutual agreement. Some landlords may offer a full 12-month or longer lease for corporate clients or established families, but 11 months is standard to simplify legal documentation and registration processes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a rented house after finalizing the agreement",
        "answer": "If the house is vacant and maintenance checks are complete, the move-in process can often be finalized within 3 to 7 working days of signing the lease and submitting the security deposit. This timeline allows for legal formalities like police verification and finalizing utility connections to be completed smoothly before handing over the keys."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is car parking available with most rental houses in Sector 10",
        "answer": "Yes, due to the nature of independent houses and the established planning of Sector 10, most properties offer dedicated parking space within the premises, usually accommodating one or two cars. For houses that do not have dedicated internal parking, ample street parking is generally available and safe due to the residential nature of the locality."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common maintenance responsibilities for tenants in Sector 10 rental houses",
        "answer": "Generally, tenants are responsible for minor day-to-day maintenance such as repairs to fuses, light bulbs, minor plumbing blockages, and general cleanliness. The landlord typically covers structural repairs, external painting, and major faults in plumbing or electrical wiring. The lease agreement clearly outlines these division of responsibilities before you rent house in Sector 10."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documents are required to finalize the house rental agreement",
        "answer": "To finalize your rental agreement, you will typically need copies of your Aadhar Card, PAN Card, passport size photographs, and sometimes employment proof or bank statements. For non-Indian nationals, a valid passport and visa are essential. We assist in compiling all necessary documents for a quick and legitimate registration process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in independent houses for rent in Sector 10",
        "answer": "The policy regarding pets varies significantly by individual landlord. While independent houses are generally more accommodating than apartments, consent is not guaranteed. If you have pets, it is crucial to mention this requirement early in your search so we can filter properties whose owners are explicitly pet-friendly, sometimes requiring a small additional pet deposit."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does rent negotiation work in the Sector 10 market",
        "answer": "Rent negotiation is possible, especially if you are committing to a longer lease period or if the house has been vacant for some time. We provide data-driven insights on comparable properties to strengthen your negotiation position. Typically, negotiations result in minor adjustments, but securing favorable terms is always our priority."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can NRIs easily rent house in Sector 10 without being physically present",
        "answer": "Yes, NRIs can easily rent properties through a legally designated Power of Attorney POA holder based in India. Alternatively, we facilitate virtual tours, digital documentation, and online transfers, ensuring the entire process is handled securely and efficiently without the NRI having to travel to India until move-in day."
