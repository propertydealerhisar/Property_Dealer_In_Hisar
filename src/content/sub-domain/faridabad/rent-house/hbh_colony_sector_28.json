        "answer": "The rental price for a 2 BHK house in HBH Colony Sector 28 Faridabad typically ranges between ₹12,000 to ₹18,000 per month, depending heavily on several factors. Key determinants include whether the unit is on a builder floor or an independent house, the age and finishing quality of the construction, and the level of furnishing provided.

      },
      {
        "question": "Are security deposits high for houses rented in HBH Colony Faridabad",
        "answer": "Standard practice for renting a house in HBH Colony Sector 28 requires a security deposit equivalent to two months' rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy, subject to deductions for any damages beyond normal wear and tear or outstanding utility bills. Some premium landlords might occasionally request a three-month deposit, especially for fully furnished or brand-new properties, but this is less common. Ensure this clause is explicitly detailed in your rental agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What lease duration is common when you rent house in HBH Colony Sector 28",
        "answer": "Most landlords in HBH Colony Sector 28 prefer a standard lease agreement of 11 months, which is renewable upon mutual agreement. This term avoids complicated registration procedures required for leases exceeding one year. If you require a longer tenure, such as a two-year lease, this must be negotiated upfront, and typically requires mandatory registration with stamp duty payment. Short-term rentals are rarely available unless specifically advertised."
      },

However, tenants are typically responsible for their own electricity, water, and gas charges.

      },
      {
        "question": "Are pets generally allowed in rental properties in HBH Colony Sector 28",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly among landlords in HBH Colony. While some independent house owners are flexible, particularly for well-behaved pets, many builder floor owners maintain a strict no-pet policy due to potential property damage or neighbor concerns. It is crucial to inform us or the landlord about your pet ownership early in the search process. Securing a pet-friendly rent house in HBH Colony Sector 28 might involve paying a slightly higher security deposit."
      },

Semi-furnished properties usually include essentials like wardrobes, basic lighting, fans, and modular kitchen fittings. Fully furnished luxury units are available but are less common and usually command a substantial premium on the monthly rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "What utility connection processes should I anticipate when I move in",
        "answer": "When you rent a house in HBH Colony Sector 28, the landlord typically provides documentation or a No Objection Certificate NOC to help you transfer or apply for new connections for electricity and water in your name. Gas connections are often cylinder-based, or if piped, require an application transfer. Ensure that all utility meters are read and recorded on the day you take possession to avoid inheriting previous outstanding bills."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I negotiate the rent price for a house in HBH Colony",
        "answer": "Yes, rent negotiation is common and expected in the HBH Colony rental market.
