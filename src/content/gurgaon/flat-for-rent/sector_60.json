        "question": "Are pet-friendly rental options common in sector 60 Gurugram flats",
        "answer": "While many individual independent house owners in sector 60 might be highly receptive and open to renting their property to responsible pet owners, securing a reliable pet-friendly Flat For Rent within established, formal housing societies can sometimes prove to be quite challenging.
