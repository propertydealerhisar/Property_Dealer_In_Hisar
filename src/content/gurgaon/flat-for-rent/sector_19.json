    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical range for security deposits when renting a flat in Sector 19",
        "answer": "The standard security deposit for a Flat For Rent in sector 19 usually ranges from one to two months' rent, depending on the flat size and furnishing status.

      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent for Sector 19 apartments",
        "answer": "Maintenance charges vary significantly depending on the specific property type. In independent builder floors or older complexes, maintenance might be separate and managed directly by the owner or a local committee. For flats in modern gated societies, the monthly rent may sometimes be quoted exclusive of society maintenance fees, which cover common area electricity, security, and cleaning. Always confirm with the property manager if the quoted rent is all-inclusive or plus maintenance."
