    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a rental agreement in dlf phase 2",
        "answer": "Most landlords in dlf phase 2 prefer a standard 11-month lease agreement which can be renewed. However, a mandatory lock-in period usually applies for the first six months, meaning neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the agreement without penalty during this initial time frame. We ensure these terms are clearly outlined before you commit to any Flat For Rent in dlf phase 2."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much security deposit is standard when renting a property here",
        "answer": "The standard practice for a Flat For Rent in dlf phase 2 is to require a security deposit equivalent to two to three months' rent. This deposit is refundable upon the termination of the lease, provided there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all dues are cleared. High-end or fully furnished properties might sometimes request up to four months' rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are builder floors or high-rise apartments more common for rent in dlf phase 2",
        "answer": "Both options are widely available, catering to different resident needs.

High-rise apartments provide premium amenities such as clubhouses, swimming pools, and centralized security, favored by corporate tenants and those seeking community life."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the common extra charges a tenant should anticipate besides the rent",
        "answer": "Beyond the monthly rent, tenants should budget for maintenance charges, which cover common area upkeep and society services.

Always clarify these charges when finalizing your Flat For Rent in dlf phase 2."

      },

        "question": "What documents are required to secure a rental flat as a salaried professional",

      {
        "question": "Can I find fully furnished Flat For Rent in dlf phase 2 or mostly unfurnished",
        "answer": "You can find a good mix. Unfurnished and semi-furnished flats are most common, providing tenants the flexibility to decorate.

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical notice period for vacating a Flat For Rent in dlf phase 2",
        "answer": "The standard notice period stipulated in most lease agreements is one or two months.
