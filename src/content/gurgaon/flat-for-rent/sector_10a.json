    "description": "We address common concerns and questions prospective tenants have regarding leases, local life, and the rental market dynamics in Sector 10A.",
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lease duration for a Flat For Rent in sector 10a",
        "answer": "The standard lease agreement duration for residential properties in Sector 10A Gurugram is 11 months, which is renewable upon mutual agreement between the tenant and the landlord. While some landlords may agree to a 12-month lease, the 11-month structure is preferred because it avoids complex registration requirements associated with leases exceeding one year. Always clarify the renewal terms and notice period before finalizing your agreement to ensure maximum flexibility and security during your tenancy."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much is the average security deposit required for rental flats here",
        "answer": "For a Flat For Rent in sector 10a, the standard practice is to request a security deposit equivalent to two months of the agreed-upon rent. This deposit is refundable at the end of the tenancy period, provided there is no damage to the property beyond normal wear and tear and all utility bills are settled. In some cases, premium or fully furnished apartments might require a three-month deposit, but this is usually negotiable based on the tenant’s profile and the landlord's specific requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are maintenance charges included in the rent or paid separately",
        "answer": "This depends entirely on the type of property you choose. For flats located within large residential societies, maintenance charges covering common area upkeep, security, and amenities are typically paid separately by the tenant to the Resident Welfare Association or the society management. If you rent an independent builder floor, maintenance might be included in the rent or handled directly by the landlord, but utility bills like electricity and water are almost always the tenant’s responsibility."

      },
      {
        "question": "Are pet animals generally allowed in rental flats in this sector",
        "answer": "Pet policies vary significantly between individual landlords and residential societies. In builder floors or independent homes, pet allowance is often negotiable with the owner.

Fully furnished units include essential furniture, appliances, and white goods.

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the typical brokerage fee for securing a rental flat here",
        "answer": "The standard brokerage fee for rental properties in Gurugram, including Sector 10A, is usually equivalent to one month’s rent plus applicable taxes, payable upon signing the lease agreement.
