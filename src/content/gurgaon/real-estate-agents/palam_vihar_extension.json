      },
      {
        "question": "How do your Real Estate Agents in Palam Vihar Extension determine a fair market price for selling my property",
        "answer": "We use a multi-faceted approach combining Comparative Market Analysis CMA with current infrastructure forecasts. We analyze recent sale prices of highly similar properties within a one-kilometer radius, accounting for factors like plot facing, size variances, age of construction, and proximity to major amenities like schools or hospitals. We also factor in pending civic body infrastructure upgrades relevant to Palam Vihar Extension Gurugram which often significantly influence future property values, ensuring the listing price maximizes seller profit while remaining competitive."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is RERA registration required for all property types being sold by agents in this area",
        "answer": "While RERA registration is mandatory for all projects exceeding 500 square meters or eight apartments, individual resale plots or homes do not typically require RERA registration.

We prioritize transactions that offer clear titles and regulatory compliance, minimizing risk for our buying clients throughout Gurugram."

We provide a detailed service agreement upfront so there are absolutely no surprises regarding fees."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the average buying process take in Palam Vihar Extension from initial search to final registration",
        "answer": "The duration varies greatly depending on buyer readiness and property verification. With our efficient Real Estate Agents in Palam Vihar Extension, we can typically narrow down suitable options within 2 to 4 weeks. Once a property is finalized, the legal due diligence, agreement drafting, and registration process usually take an additional 4 to 8 weeks, assuming the title is clear and documentation is readily available from the seller."
