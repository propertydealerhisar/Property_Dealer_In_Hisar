      {
        "question": "What commission rates do Real Estate Agents in Sector 83 typically charge for residential sales",
        "answer": "Commission structures in Sector 83 Gurugram generally range between 1 to 2 percent of the total transaction value for residential properties.

      },
      {
        "question": "How do agents determine the best selling price for my flat in Sector 83",
        "answer": "The best selling price is determined through a comprehensive Comparative Market Analysis or CMA. Agents examine recently sold similar properties within Sector 83, assess the property's condition, analyze current market demand, and evaluate unique features like floor level, view, and specific society amenities. They also factor in infrastructure developments like the nearby Dwarka Expressway which influences premium pricing in the area."

        "question": "Is it better to use multiple agents or one exclusive agent for selling property in Gurugram Sector 83",
