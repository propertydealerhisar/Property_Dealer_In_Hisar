    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a shop for rent in Palam Vihar Pocket H",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for commercial rentals in Palam Vihar Pocket H usually ranges from 12 to 36 months, depending on the size of the shop and the landlord’s preference. A lock-in period means neither the tenant nor the landlord can terminate the lease agreement early without facing penalty. For premium, large format shops, landlords might request a longer lock-in period to ensure stability. Always review this clause carefully during negotiations, as it significantly impacts your operational flexibility and long-term commitment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the rental escalation structured for commercial leases in this area",
        "answer": "Rental escalation is typically structured in the agreement to increase annually, often falling between 5% and 10% per year. The exact percentage depends on the current market conditions and the perceived growth rate of Palam Vihar Pocket H. Some long-term leases might include a step-up rent clause where the rent increases substantially after a predetermined period, like three years. Clarifying the escalation structure upfront is vital for accurate financial forecasting of your business."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there specific zoning restrictions for a shop for rent in Palam Vihar Pocket H",
        "answer": "While Palam Vihar Pocket H is designated for commercial activity, there might be specific restrictions regarding the type of business operating there, especially concerning noise levels, environmental impact, or late-night operations.

It is essential to verify with local authorities and the landlord that your intended business type complies with all zoning and usage regulations before finalising the lease agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security deposit is usually required for commercial properties here",
        "answer": "The security deposit for a shop for rent in Palam Vihar Pocket H generally ranges from three to six months' rent. This deposit is held by the landlord throughout the lease duration and is refundable upon the satisfactory termination of the agreement, provided there is no damage to the property or outstanding dues. Negotiating the security deposit amount can sometimes be possible, particularly if your business profile is very strong."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is responsible for property maintenance and repairs in a rented shop",
        "answer": "Generally, the tenant is responsible for minor internal repairs and routine maintenance, such as fixing light fixtures or small plumbing issues within the shop unit. The landlord typically remains responsible for major structural repairs, common area maintenance, and external facade upkeep. The lease agreement will clearly delineate responsibilities, especially regarding HVAC systems and specialized commercial fittings. Always confirm these terms to avoid future disputes regarding repair costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I assess the foot traffic for a shop for rent before signing the lease",
        "answer": "To accurately assess foot traffic for a specific shop for rent in Palam Vihar Pocket H, prospective tenants should visit the location multiple times throughout the day and on different days of the week, including weekends. Observe the flow of pedestrians, public transport proximity, and the occupancy rate of neighbouring businesses. Utilizing local demographic data and consulting with our real estate experts can provide a quantified assessment of the commercial potential."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are utility charges included in the rent or paid separately by the tenant",
        "answer": "In almost all commercial rental agreements for shops in Palam Vihar Pocket H, utility charges including electricity, water, and internet are not included in the monthly rent and must be paid separately by the tenant. The tenant is typically required to transfer utility connections into their name or pay based on sub-meter readings provided by the property management. Ensure the shop unit has adequate electrical load capacity for your specific commercial equipment needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What paperwork is necessary to finalise the shop rental process in this area",
        "answer": "To finalise the rental of a shop in Palam Vihar Pocket H, you will generally need a signed Lease Deed, attested copies of the business registration documents, PAN card and Aadhar card of the authorised signatories, and proof of payment for the security deposit and first month's rent. Professional assistance ensures all legal documentation is accurate and protects both the tenant and the landlord throughout the commercial tenure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I renovate or modify the interior of the rented shop space",
        "answer": "Any significant renovations or structural modifications to the shop interior must be explicitly approved in writing by the landlord before commencement. Minor cosmetic changes like painting or shelving installation might be permissible without formal approval, but it is always best practice to communicate intentions. The lease agreement will specify whether the property must be restored to its original condition upon vacating the shop for rent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking easily available for customers and employees near the rented shops",
        "answer": "Parking availability varies by location within Palam Vihar Pocket H. Shops situated in designated commercial complexes usually offer basement or dedicated surface parking.
