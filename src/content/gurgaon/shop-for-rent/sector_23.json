    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the typical lock-in period for a shop rental agreement in Sector 23 Gurugram",
        "answer": "The standard lock-in period for commercial properties in major markets like Sector 23 typically ranges from 12 to 36 months, though this is highly negotiable based on the property size and the scale of the tenant’s business. Landlords usually require a minimum lock-in period to safeguard their investment against short-term vacancies. For larger showrooms or properties requiring extensive tenant fit-outs, the lock-in period might extend towards 3 years, offering stability to both parties. Always clarify the implications of breaking the lock-in clause during negotiations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there additional costs besides the monthly rent for a commercial shop in this area",
        "answer": "Yes, beyond the quoted monthly rent, tenants should anticipate several recurring and upfront costs. Recurring costs typically include common area maintenance charges (CAM), property taxes (sometimes passed through), electricity and water consumption, and specialized service charges if located within a complex. Upfront costs involve a security deposit, usually equivalent to 3 to 6 months' rent, stamp duty and registration fees for the lease deed, and brokerage fees, which are generally one month’s rent plus GST."
      },
      {
        "question": "What documentation is required to finalize a commercial lease agreement in Sector 23",
        "answer": "To finalize a commercial lease, tenants typically need to provide KYC documents for all directors or proprietors, including Aadhaar card, PAN card, and proof of residence. Additionally, business registration documents such as GST registration certificate, Certificate of Incorporation (for companies), and bank statements might be required. The lease agreement itself must be properly drafted, stamped, and registered with the relevant authorities to ensure legal validity and enforceability for the tenure of the rental period."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I modify the interior layout of the rented shop space in Sector 23",
        "answer": "Interior modifications are generally permitted, but they must adhere strictly to the terms outlined in the lease agreement and often require prior written approval from the landlord. Minor changes like painting or shelving are usually accepted. However, structural modifications, changes to external signage, or significant alterations to the electrical or plumbing systems will require detailed plans submitted to the landlord for formal sanction. Tenants are typically required to restore the property to its original condition upon lease expiration, unless otherwise stipulated."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the rental escalation clause typically work for shops in Sector 23",
        "answer": "Rental escalation clauses are standard in commercial leases in Sector 23 to account for market inflation and property appreciation. The most common structure involves a fixed percentage increase, usually between 5% and 10%, applied annually or every two years. For leases spanning five years or more, sometimes a revision linked to the prevailing market rates at the time of renewal is stipulated, providing a mechanism for fair market rent adjustment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the best type of shop size for a café or restaurant setup in Sector 23 Gurugram",
        "answer": "For a standard café or a quick-service restaurant (QSR), a size between 350 sq ft and 700 sq ft is generally optimal. This allows sufficient space for a kitchen, counter service, customer seating, and essential washroom facilities. Location is paramount; spaces with good ventilation and access to municipal drainage systems are highly preferred. Look for properties on the ground floor with good street visibility and adequate provision for external signage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking easily available for customers visiting shops in Sector 23 markets",
        "answer": "Parking availability varies significantly across Sector 23. Main commercial complexes often provide dedicated basement or surface parking for customers and employees. However, shops situated directly on high streets or in older HUDA markets may rely on street parking, which can be limited during peak hours. Always verify the dedicated parking facilities associated with a specific property before signing the lease, especially if your business anticipates high customer traffic."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a rented shop after signing the agreement",
        "answer": "The move-in timeline depends on the current state of the property. If the shop is already 'ready to move' or 'bare shell', and the lease agreement is stamped and registered, you could potentially take possession within 7 to 15 days. If the space requires extensive fit-outs, the timeline will stretch depending on the construction and interior work involved. Securing all local trade licenses should be initiated immediately upon possession to prevent operational delays."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are Sector 23 shop rentals suitable for businesses requiring 24-hour operations",
        "answer": "Yes, Sector 23 includes commercial properties suitable for 24-hour operations, such as pharmacies, specialized data centers, or essential service businesses, especially in designated commercial zones or complexes that offer round-the-clock security and utility backup. However, this must be explicitly negotiated and included in the lease agreement, and relevant permissions from local authorities for late-night operation must be secured by the tenant."
      },
      {
        "question": "What factors influence the security deposit amount for commercial shops here",
        "answer": "The security deposit is primarily influenced by the prestige of the commercial location, the size of the shop, and the potential risk profile of the tenant's business. Prime ground floor shops in high-footfall areas usually command a higher deposit (up to 6 months rent). Tenants with strong financial backing and long-term lease commitments may be able to negotiate a slightly lower deposit, though 3 to 6 months remains the standard industry practice across Sector 23."
