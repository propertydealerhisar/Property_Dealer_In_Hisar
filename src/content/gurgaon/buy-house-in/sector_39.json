Generally, a 3 BHK builder floor starts around INR 180 Lakh and can go up to INR 350 Lakh or more for premium floors or newer constructions.

Builder floors offer better liquidity and higher rental yields, making them suitable for passive income generation. Independent houses and Kothis provide greater capital appreciation potential in the long run, especially if located on large plots that can be redeveloped. Sector 39 is a mature market, meaning both property types generally hold their value well, but independent plots offer superior control over the asset."

Our team provides dedicated legal assistance to streamline this due diligence process for all our clients."
      },
